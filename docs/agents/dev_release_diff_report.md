# Dev -> Release Diff Report (TEMP)

Generated: January 30, 2026  
Scope: `git diff dev..release` (local `dev` vs `release` branch)  
Purpose: Human-readable staging doc for wiki updates (no code dumps).

---

## Executive Summary
- Release adds **new media types (Music, Podcast, Board Game)** plus a **Collection** system with rich metadata.
- The **Statistics** and **History** experiences are heavily rebuilt: cached, filterable, and chart-rich.
- **Integrations expand** to Plex/Pocket Casts/Last.fm/Jellyseerr/Jellyfin/Emby with new import flows and webhooks.
- **Preferences and UI** get major upgrades: new Settings navigation, date/time formats, mobile layout options, sort direction toggles, and more.
- Infrastructure gains **runtime population tasks**, SQLite resiliency, cache status APIs, and improved Docker metadata.

---

## 1) Navigation, Layout & Global UI
- **New Settings navigation** (sidebar in Settings pages) and a **dedicated Preferences page** alongside Account/Notifications/Integrations/Import/Export/Advanced/About.
- **Base layout refinements**: updated padding/margins, higher z-index header, improved mobile sidebar behavior, and per-user mobile layout data attributes.
- **Public view support**: new `base_public.html` with simplified header/footer and no sidebar/search (used for public pages).
- **Search bar enhancements**:
  - Dynamic media-type dropdown now respects enabled media types.
  - **Book barcode scanning** via ZXing and image upload; inline error feedback.
- **Media card hover behavior** improved with dynamic title expansion (JS calculates extra height) and optional subtitle display setting.
- **New icons** added (camera, microphone, speaker, signal, shield-alert, globe), plus updated icon usage in navigation and templates.

---

---

## 7) Statistics Overhaul
User-facing:

---

## 9) Media Details & Tracking

---

## 13) Background Tasks, Caching & Resilience
- New Celery tasks for **runtime population**, **statistics caching**, **music validation/scrobbling**, and integration workflows.
- **Runtime population** can be scheduled on startup (guarded by cache availability + non-Celery process).
- **Database retry middleware**: automatic retry on SQLite lock/disk I/O errors.
- **SQLite PRAGMA tuning** (WAL + busy timeout + synchronous setting).

---

## 14) Deployment / Infra / Config Changes

- Docker Compose now points to fork images, adds network wiring, and `ADMIN_ENABLED` env variable.
- PostgreSQL compose now uses named volume instead of `./db`.
- Settings changes include:
  - `DEBUG` default true (local dev oriented).
  - Cookie path fixes for `BASE_URL`.
  - Plex + Last.fm + BGG env vars.
  - Commit hash + fork owner detection for UI/footer.
  - Expanded Celery accept content list.

---

## 15) Docs, Tests & Tooling

- Added `stylelintrc` and Djlint indentation config.
- New dependency: `defusedxml`.

---

## 16) Static Assets & Styling

- New JS modules: barcode scanner, cache updater, statistics charts, date-range picker.
- New assets/logos: Last.fm, Plex, Pocket Casts.

---

## 17) Potential Cleanup / Noise
- `.DS_Store` files appear in `src/`, `src/app/`, `src/static/`, `src/templates/`, `src/users/` - likely accidental.
