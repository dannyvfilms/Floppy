# Build inputs outside the lockfiles

`uv.lock` and `package-lock.json` do not cover the browser files committed under
`src/static/` or the files the installer downloads. This page is the inventory
and the update boundary for those inputs.

## Vendored browser libraries

`src/static/vendor-manifest.json` is the machine-readable record: name, version,
license, upstream repository, source artifact, SHA-256 and size of every
vendored file. `app.tests.test_static_libraries.VendorManifestTests` fails when a
file changes without its record, or when a new `*.min.*` file appears in
`js/libraries/` or `css/libraries/` without one. ZXing additionally keeps its
license and `PROVENANCE.txt` beside the bundle (the pattern for a library that
needs a full source/tag record).

| Library | Version | License | File | SHA-256 |

Roboto Flex's upstream release was not recorded when it was vendored; the digest
pins today's bytes only.

### Updating a vendored library

1. Pick an exact upstream release; read its notes and check its advisories
   (GitHub Security Advisories for the upstream repository, `npm audit` on the
   package at that version). Existing pins are not upgraded just to clear a
   low-impact advisory; record the decision in the PR.
2. Replace the file with a versioned name, taken from the registry tarball or the
   release asset named in `source_artifact`.
3. Update `vendor-manifest.json` (version, file, sha256, size) and the template
   reference together.
4. Run `scripts/test.sh app.tests.test_static_libraries`, then lint.

## Installer and bootstrap downloads

| Input | Pin | Verified |
|---|---|---|
| Floppy source (`scripts/install.sh`) | branch by default; `--commit <40-hex SHA>` for an immutable install | `HEAD` must equal the SHA after checkout; a resume refuses a different commit |
| uv (`scripts/install/source_common.sh`) | version `0.12.3` | SHA-256 of `https://astral.sh/uv/<version>/install.sh` is checked before it runs; override with `FLOPPY_UV_INSTALLER_SHA256`, otherwise a non-default version runs unverified with a warning |
| Docker image | `Dockerfile` base images and uv image are `@sha256:` pinned | by the container runtime |
| Python dependencies | `uv sync --locked` | hashes in `uv.lock` |

Immutable source install:

```bash
bash floppy-install.sh --commit <full-commit-sha>
```

Bump the uv version, `UV_INSTALLER_SHA256` and `pyproject.toml` together.

### Remaining trust

- HTTPS and the certificate authorities for github.com and astral.sh. The
  bootstrap script itself is fetched over HTTPS and cannot verify itself; pin a
  copy of it if that matters.
- The uv installer script is verified, but it then downloads the uv binary,
  which the script checks against its own embedded digest.
- OS package repositories and Docker's apt repository/GPG key
  (`scripts/install/docker.sh`), Homebrew's installer on macOS, and the Tailwind
  CLI are not pinned or digest-checked.
