# Statistics sync

How the Statistics page stays warm, why it is built this way, and what to check
when it looks wrong. Replaces the chunked "refresh run" design (#1272).

## The promise

The user never waits for Statistics and never sees a refresh banner. Every
change marks what it touched; a background sync rebuilds that and republishes
the ranges before the page is next opened. The page always serves the last
published numbers. Only two things show progress:

* the **Refresh** button, and
* a range that has **never** been built (fresh install, new user), which shows
  "Building your statistics for the first time…" once and reloads when ready.

A small "Updated N minutes ago" next to the Refresh button is the only other
indicator.

## Two layers

| Layer | Unit | Where | Rebuilt when |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Day payload | one user, one local day | cache (`stats:day:v7:{uid}:{day}`) | the day is dirty, missing, or today/yesterday |
| Range snapshot | one user, one predefined range | database (`StatisticsSnapshot`) + cache copy | its generation trails the user's, or it was built on an earlier local day |

Day payloads are derived and rebuildable, so they stay in the cache. A range
payload also reads live database state (undated items, current status and
score, reading completions, talent), which is why *any* change makes every
range stale while only the days it touched need rebuilding.

## Durable state (`app/models/statistics.py`)

* `StatisticsDirtyDay(user, day, token)` — one row per dirty day. Marking is an
  upsert that rewrites the token. A sync clears only rows whose token still
  matches what it read, so a day re-marked mid-rebuild stays dirty.
* `StatisticsSyncState(user)` — `generation` counts changes; the synced
  generations, `synced_day`, the lease and `full_sweep_requested_at` let one
  query find unfinished work.
* `StatisticsSnapshot(user, range_name)` — the published payload, stored
  dehydrated: model rows become references re-fetched on read
  (`statistics_sync.dehydrate_payload` / `hydrate_payload`).

Why the database: the cache is `volatile-lru` and shares its budget with
provider payloads (`app/redis_tuning.py`). The old design kept the dirty list,
the freshness token, the run lock and the published payloads there, so an
eviction dropped invalidations or blanked a page, and the dirty list was a
non-atomic read-modify-write. `BackfillReconcileState` moved out of the cache
for the same reason (#521).

## Marking (`app/statistics_sync.py`)

* `mark_days(user_id, days)` — upserts dirty rows, drops those day payloads,
  bumps the generation, and queues a sync on commit.
* `mark_aggregate(user_id)` — a change no day captures (undated items, status,
  score, credits — talent is aggregated per range from the database). Bumps the
  generation only; no day is rebuilt.
* `mark_rows(user_id, rows)` — for bulk writes that skip signals.

The older names still work and route here: `invalidate_statistics_days` →
`mark_days`, `invalidate_statistics_cache` and `schedule_all_ranges_refresh` →
`mark_aggregate`, `invalidate_all_statistics_days` → drop every day payload and
request a full sweep (imports, provider migrations, preference changes).

## The sync

`statistics_sync_task(user_id)` runs `run_sync` on the interactive queue at
`CELERY_TASK_PRIORITY_STATISTICS_SYNC = 1`: behind webhooks (0), ahead of
follow-up imports and backfills (3+). That matters on the minimal tier, where
one worker consumes every queue.

When an interactive browser request is active, the background task yields before
claiming its database lease or between day slices and ranges. The reconciler
finds deferred work after browsing quiets down. Snapshot publication uses one
database upsert per range to avoid a read-then-write lock upgrade.

1. Claim the database lease (a sync already running → return).
2. Read the generation and the dirty rows (with tokens).
3. Build days, newest first, in prefetched slices of
   `STATISTICS_SYNC_SLICE_DAYS`: dirty days, today and yesterday, and on a full
   sweep every day payload the cache is missing (a missing
   `stats:sync:day_epoch:{uid}` key, written without a TTL, means the cache was
   flushed). Clear each slice's dirty rows as it lands.
4. Publish ranges that trail: the hot ranges (Today … Last 30 Days) on every
   pass — a scrobble reaches them in seconds. The heavy ranges (Last 90 Days …
   All Time, the user's default first among them) wait until changes have been
   quiet for `STATISTICS_SYNC_HEAVY_SETTLE_SECONDS` (90 s) but never trail by
   more than `STATISTICS_SYNC_HEAVY_MAX_DELAY_SECONDS` (10 min); a new day, a
   full sweep or a manual refresh makes them due at once. On a large library
   one All Time aggregate takes ~15 s and cannot be split, which is why it is
   not rebuilt on every pass while changes keep arriving.
   Each range builds any calendar day it has never built with one prefetch per
   slice first.
5. Record progress, release the lease, and queue another pass if changes landed
   meanwhile.

**It never aborts.** A snapshot built at generation *g* is still newer than the
one it replaces; a change during the sync simply causes another pass. The old
design aborted on every version change and needed a settling window to stop
restarting in a loop.

**It is bounded.** After `STATISTICS_SYNC_TASK_BUDGET_SECONDS` (10 s) it stops
at the next slice or range, queues its own continuation and returns, so the
single-slot interactive worker is never held for a whole All Time rebuild.

A range aggregate cannot stop partway, so the budget is enforced by choosing
what to start: each finished range records its cost (`stats:sync:range_seconds`),
and a task starts a further range only if it is expected to fit in what is left.
The first range a task builds always runs, so a range dearer than a whole budget
still gets a task of its own. At each slice and range boundary the sync also
looks at the broker and yields when a webhook-priority (0) task is queued: the
worker cannot be preempted, so this is the only way a scrobble waits for one
slice instead of one task. The worst case is therefore the budget plus one range.
A sync more than 5 s over budget logs `stats_sync_overrun` naming its slowest
range; `stats_sync` carries `days` and `days_ms` for the day-building phase.

The highlights ("on this day") read the History day cache and keep any day they
had to build, so a History cache that keeps losing days (see the coverage repair
reasons in the log) also makes every Statistics range slower.

## Lease fencing — an expired worker is inert

The lease carries a fencing token (`StatisticsSyncState.lease_token`), rotated
on every claim. Every state-touching operation is fenced on it:

* **Claim** (`_claim_lease`) is one atomic `UPDATE` that installs a fresh token;
  only a free-or-expired lease (or an explicit takeover) can win it.
* **Renew** (`_renew_lease`) and **release** only match the caller's token, so
  an expired worker can neither extend a successor's lease nor release it and
  admit a third sync while the successor runs.
* **Publication** (`publish_snapshot`) runs its ownership renewal and its
  snapshot write inside one transaction, and the write itself refuses to move a
  range to an older generation (`generation__lte` update, insert on miss,
  `IntegrityError` on a lost insert race). Redis publication is not atomic
  with database commit. `load_snapshot` checks the durable generation,
  publication time and schema version before accepting a cache entry, so a
  delayed write or outer transaction rollback cannot expose the wrong
  revision. A warm read adds one indexed metadata query; the payload column
  is fetched only on a miss. Equal-generation rebuilds are distinguished by
  publication time. Status pollers also read only durable metadata; a separate
  Redis metadata copy could otherwise describe a rolled-back publication.
* **Day publication** renews ownership inside a transaction after building
  each slice, holding the state-row write lock through the cache writes and
  dirty-day clearing. A worker that lost its lease during the expensive
  build cannot overwrite its successor's days. The full-sweep epoch marker
  uses the same fence.
* **Markers** (`hot/heavy_synced_generation`, `synced_day`) advance
  monotonically (`Greatest`) and only under the caller's token, so a stale pass
  cannot regress what a successor recorded; the full-sweep clear is likewise
  fenced and bounded by the pass's start time.

A worker that loses its lease gets `status="lost_lease"` and stops touching the
user's state; the inline read path treats that like `busy` and leaves durable
work for the successor. Dirty-day clearing also checks the captured dirty
token so a newer invalidation remains queued. **Drain all old workers before
upgrading and restart them together after migration 0195.** Old workers do
not rotate or honor the fencing token; mixed-version execution does not have
the new ownership guarantees.

Regression: `app/tests/test_statistics_lease_fencing.py` drives claim/renew/
release/publication/marker schedules deterministically, including the
successor-arrives-mid-range case.

## The reconciler — why a lost message cannot strand a page

`Reconcile statistics sync` runs every 60 s (on the interactive worker, so a
long import on the background worker cannot delay it). One query finds users
whose lease is free and who have dirty rows, an unsynced generation, a pending
full sweep, overdue heavy ranges, or a `synced_day` before today — and queues a
sync for each. That covers every way a sync message can go missing (a dropped
or starved message, a worker restart, a second consumer on the same Redis) and
also midnight rollover and the first build after an upgrade: users with no
state row are bootstrapped with a full sweep.

## The read path

`statistics_cache.get_statistics_data` loads the snapshot (cache, then
database). Stale → `ensure_sync` (gated, idempotent) and serve it anyway. None
→ an empty payload with `statistics_building=True`, and an urgent sync.
`/api/cache-status/` reports the snapshot and never touches a running sync.

Eager/test mode (`CELERY_TASK_ALWAYS_EAGER` or `TESTING`) has no worker, so the
read path rebuilds the requested range inline and `ensure_sync` is a no-op.
Tests that exercise the real queueing override both settings and patch
`app.tasks_interactive.statistics_sync_task.apply_async`
(`app/tests/test_statistics_sync.py`).

## Manual refresh

`request_manual_refresh(user, range_name)` marks every day in that range dirty,
requests a full sweep (so the heavy ranges are due too), and queues an urgent
sync. It no longer throws away every day payload the user has.

## What marks changes

Signals (`app/signals.py`, `_handle_media_cache_change`) mark the days a media
row touched; a change with no day marks the aggregate. A `pre_save`/`post_save`
pair marks the day a Movie, Music, Podcast, Game, BoardGame, Anime, Manga, Book
or Comic entry moved *away* from (Episode already did this). Paths without
signals mark explicitly: generic imports and Pocket Casts
(`invalidate_all_statistics_days`), the TV and season completion fan-outs,
episode-order remaps, music track relinks and TV provider migrations.

If you add a write path that bypasses signals (`bulk_create`, `bulk_update`,
`queryset.update`) on anything Statistics reads, mark it.

## Retired

`statistics_refresh_run.py`, the refresh lock, the Redis dirty list, the
per-user `history_version` as a freshness token (it remains only as the change
token for the per-person talent caches), `STATISTICS_REFRESH_CHUNK_*`,
`STATISTICS_REFRESH_RUN_LEASE`, `STATISTICS_HISTORY_DEBOUNCE_SECONDS` and
`CELERY_TASK_PRIORITY_STATISTICS_CONTINUATION`. The task names
`app.tasks.refresh_statistics_cache_task` and
`app.tasks.continue_statistics_refresh_task` stay registered for one release and
run a sync, so messages queued by the previous version drain cleanly.

## #1272 — what went wrong

The reporter's worker logged the START of two refresh runs but never received
a chunk continuation, so neither run finished. Every further Refresh only
recorded a follow-up against the still-live lock, and the page polled until its
180 s timeout. Nothing could recover it: progress depended on each
self-published continuation arriving, and no periodic task looked for stuck
runs. Separately, `cache_status` deleted a live run's lock whenever the
published entry looked fresh, and the next chunk aborted silently. The sync
above has no message whose loss matters, and polling never touches it.

## Log lines

| Line | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `stats_mark user_id days reason` | a change was recorded |
| `stats_sync user_id status ranges elapsed_ms` | a sync pass ended (`done`, `continued`, `busy`, `lost_lease`) |
| `stats_range_summary user_id range generation elapsed_ms` | one range published |
| `stats_snapshot_superseded user_id range generation` | a publish was skipped: a newer generation is already out |
| `stats_reconcile candidates queued` | the reconciler found unfinished work |
| `stats_sync_enqueue_failed` | the broker refused a sync; the reconciler will retry |

`StatisticsSyncState.last_error` holds the last exception a sync raised.
