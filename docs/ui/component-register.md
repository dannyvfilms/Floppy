# UI component register

For Expo versus PWA page status and remaining work, see the
[Expo parity audit](expo-parity-audit.md).

Use the [architecture and parity gates](../architecture/ui-modernization.md) and
[complete source ownership map](source-map.md). IDs identify behavior families,
not individual HTML elements. Slots, cells and small includes belong to their
parent family unless they acquire an independent contract. Paths below are entry
points; the map enumerates every member. Existing backend contracts remain authoritative.

## Status and maintenance

Every agent edit to a UI component, including copy or styling, upgrades that
component to the shared React pattern with visual and behavioral parity. Reuse or
extend shared components first. This incrementally prepares shared presentation
for eventual native iOS and Android apps and reduces a future bulk migration.
Every changed component must record ownership/migration state for each affected
surface and update the source map. Only evidenced compatibility blockers permit
deferral; record their reopening condition and report them explicitly.

A component is migrated on every surface that uses it, public pages (public lists,
auth and error screens) and signed-in pages alike. Check both shells (`base.html` and
`base_public.html`) and the `public_view` paths before marking a surface done, and
record any public consumer that is left behind.

Every entry has exactly one `- Status:` line that starts with one of these terms in
backticks (`scripts/check_ui_docs.py` enforces it and `docs/ui/source-map.md` repeats it):

- `Legacy`: server templates, Alpine and HTMX own the component. It may draw shared
  React pieces (media cards, `Button`, `Badge`, `Spinner`); the status line names them.
  No React component belongs to the family itself. Open for anyone to take.
- `Partial / coexisting`: a React component owned by this family is mounted on at least
  one surface and the rest of the family is still legacy. The status line says which is which.
- `Web Migrated`: React owns the family on every web surface that uses it. Anything left
  is a different kind of component and is listed with a reason.
- `Deferred (blocker)`: legacy, with an evidenced blocker and a reopening condition
  recorded in the entry. Not open until the condition is met.
- `Existing (no UI work needed)`: a shared foundation (design tokens), not a component to port.

Every `Partial / coexisting` or `Web Migrated` entry also has one `- Native readiness:`
line that starts with one of these terms in backticks. Status says how much of the web
UI React owns; this line says whether that React could also run on iOS and Android
(rules and measurements: [From React on the web to native
apps](../architecture/ui-modernization.md#from-react-on-the-web-to-native-apps)). A
`Web Migrated` entry can be `DOM`: React on the web is not native readiness.

- `DOM`: the presentation is React DOM (HTML tags and CSS classes). A rewrite to
  `react-native` primitives and tokens is still owed before it can run on a phone.
- `Primitives`: the presentation uses `react-native` primitives and no browser API, so
  it renders through react-native-web today. Not run on iOS or Android; its data may
  still arrive only through server-rendered props.
- `Ready`: primitives, no browser API, a JSON data path, and the same source verified
  on both iOS and Android with the result recorded. No entry is `Ready`.
- `Web-only`: a web implementation by nature (charts, camera, drag-and-drop); the line
  names what a native screen would use instead.
- `n/a`: no presentation of its own.

Native iOS and Android are not verified for any entry; `Verification` lines say exactly
what was run. A status is decided from the code, not from older prose: an entry is
`Partial / coexisting` or better only if a React component that the family owns is
mounted by the loader (`frontend/settings/index.js`). To re-check a status run
`python3 scripts/ui_migration_metrics.py --entries`, which lists the React islands that each
entry's own templates mount, then read the mounted component's file. How the migration
percentage is measured is in [migration-measurement.md](migration-measurement.md).

**Defaults for every entry below:** verification is static source inspection only,
browser migration not performed, native not tested. Test references are available
regression targets, **not executed test results**. Related work and recurring
deferrals: none recorded; attach real issue/PR links when known. The settings-card
shell is the first authorized browser pilot; native proof remains open. Ordinary
unassessed components stay `Legacy` rather than prematurely becoming exceptions.

When a component changes, update affected paths/contracts and add or refresh the
explicit fields: `Status`, `Verification` (commands/results, surfaces, platforms/versions and limits),
`Related work`, and `Deferrals` (reason and reopening condition). These override the
defaults. Keep implementation and verification distinct. For partial migrations,
name migrated/legacy consumers and retirement conditions; one migrated variant does
not verify the whole family. Retain retired IDs with replacement references. Check
only affected records for small changes, not the whole inventory.

### Finding work and partially modernized pages

High shared leverage: `MEDIA-CARD`, `RATING`, `FILTERS`, `RAILS`, `DATE-TIME`,
`FORM-CONTROLS`. Parallel presentation worth assessing: add/recommend search previews,
inline settings dropdowns, shell controls, card/table metadata and media-type visual
mappings in `date-range.js` versus `app/config.py`. Consolidate only matching contracts.

Page composition index (existing stack except shared card shells and the full AniList provider region):

- Home: `SHELL`, `HOME`, `RAILS`, `MEDIA-CARD`, `PLAYBACK`, `PROGRESS`.
- Library/search/discover: `LIBRARY`, `FILTERS`, `TABLES`, `BULK`, `SEARCH`, `DISCOVER`, `MEDIA-CARD`.
- Detail: `DETAIL`, `CHILDREN`, `RATING`, `TRACKING`, `NOTES`, `ARTWORK`, `MUSIC`, `PEOPLE`, `PROGRESS`, `INTEGRATION-PANELS`.
- History/statistics/calendar: `HISTORY`, `STATISTICS`, `RELEASE-CALENDAR`, `DATE-TIME`, `FILTERS`.
- Collection/tags/lists: `OWNERSHIP`, `CUSTOM-FIELDS`, `TAGS`, `LISTS`, `SMART-RULES`, `LIST-CURATION`, `TIERS`; shared cards/filters/tables.
- Settings: `SET-*`, `FORM-CONTROLS`, `AUTH`, `ONBOARDING`; integration routes also use `MATCH-REVIEW`, `DEVICE-CONNECT`, `STREMIO`.

Use constituent IDs and explicit consumer overrides to find partial pages; use status
and blockers to find remaining work: `Legacy` entries are open, `Deferred (blocker)`
entries need their reopening condition met first. For churn, aggregate paths from
`git log --format= --name-only --since='90 days ago' -- src/templates src/static/js`
before printing bounded results, then join paths to map IDs. No churn ranking is
asserted here. Record recurring deferrals so frequently touched legacy components
can inform a focused completion pass.

## Structure and shared presentation

### SHELL — Application and public shells

Restored adapter evidence: **web — Runtime**, PWA Home and Sidebar inspected beside Expo; browser source is unchanged. **iOS — Runtime**, Home, Sidebar, Search and populated library/provider Search Results inspected in Expo Go on the Duo. **Android — Runtime for Search preview only**, screenshot inspected; full Home, Sidebar and Search Results rendering remains unverified, with platform bundle and transport checks only. These checks do not establish complete interaction, theme or accessibility parity.

The Expo adapter mounts the shared `Sidebar` directly in the drawer, preserving its full-height flex layout and the reviewed navigation spacing. Guided setup remains separate from the drawer; no setup banner is inserted above its rows. Account-backed pins, loading/retry, sign-out errors and onboarding remain adapter-owned. Shared Sidebar ownership stays fully React-owned with the existing coexisting web fallback and retirement conditions.

Sidebar retains the accepted text metrics and anchored menu presentation while platform keyboard/menu-layer behavior stays in adapters. Account-backed pins and the legacy local-storage adoption path remain. Ownership and fallback retirement conditions are unchanged; the integration does not establish new iOS or Android runtime acceptance.

- The saved-view/sidebar fallback adapter loads before Alpine and also registers against an already-running Alpine instance; its global guard prevents duplicate registration. This preserves the shared React-owned Sidebar and its existing coexisting server fallback. Browser regressions verify script order, late fallback insertion and Explore toggling without JavaScript errors. Fallback retirement remains dependent on complete parity and the no-JavaScript policy; iOS/Android runtime is not established by this browser bootstrap check.

- The Django head loads the development toolbar only when its DOM root is present, including responses that omit the toolbar. Provider browser coverage exercises this lifecycle. Shell ownership and fallback retirement conditions are unchanged; this browser-only adapter has no iOS or Android runtime verification.

Native screen adapters omit empty headers and read heading/section colors at render time. The shared `Shell` stacks its search menus above the following native screen content; Expo browser verified pointer selection over a Settings card closes the menu and changes the type. Settings pages share `SettingsSurface`, and changing its active page resets the scroll container. Setup renders outside the signed-in header. Browser file pickers keep a hidden file input attached until selection, cancellation or failure, then remove it; file access stays in the web adapter. Browser verification is recorded per surface; iOS is not verified, and Android is not verified. Native readiness remains `Primitives`.

- Purpose/usage: app navigation/header/sidebar/mobile overlay; distinct public/auth shell; settings uses the app shell.
- Alphabet composition: both shells expose an empty body-level slot outside animated
  content so the fixed rail stays viewport-bound; the public shell uses the same
  lazy island loader. Shell navigation/controls remain legacy and visually unchanged.
- Implementation: `src/templates/base.html`, `src/templates/base_public.html`, `src/templates/app/components/sidebar_navigation_items.html`, `src/static/js/safari-rail.js`; Django, inline Alpine and HTMX boost.
- Contract: enabled/pinned links, responsive menu/safe areas, public/auth differences, auth redirects, history cache safety, shared modal targets and response events.
- Data: request/user/context, template tags and navigation preferences in `src/users/views.py`.
- Reuse/blockers: share navigation values/tokens; document layout, history and Safari rail need platform adapters. Do not merge distinct public/auth semantics.
- Status: `Partial / coexisting`. The signed-in sidebar (logo, media-type links with saved-view groups, the Explore section with pinning and pinned lists, Appearance, Settings, Logout) is React-owned through `frontend/ui/Sidebar.jsx` and `mountSidebar.jsx`, fed by `src/app/sidebar_model.py` and the `sidebar_react` tag. Icons travel as parsed shapes through one shared `Icon`. Pins and pinned lists are stored on the account (`User.sidebar_pins`, saved through `sidebar_pins`) and shared with the list pin buttons through `window.floppySidebarPins`; pins an older version kept in this browser's localStorage move to the account on first load. Group open states stay in localStorage. The mobile open and close state, the top bar and the public shell stay Alpine and Django. The onboarding banner stays server-rendered and is placed into the sidebar. The Alpine sidebar markup stays inside the host as the fallback. The Finish setting up Floppy badge has been removed from the sidebar.
- The iOS side rail adds Back on non-Home routes using the app navigation history; Home has no Back. Its canvas omits the bottom safe-area inset when the system rail is present. The menu toggle is the first button below the Wi-Fi indicator in the system side-rail toolbar; a modal replaces it with an X in the same slot.
- Expo iOS uses `NativeShell` as the platform adapter around shared `Sidebar` and search: the native rail toggles an animated, non-modal sidebar, with larger sidebar rows on a supported foldable or vertical rail. Native reserved regions or Expo Go's system arrangement provide the partially folded layout. Expo Android and browser retain the existing `Shell`/`MobileNav` path. On a physical iOS 27.2 Duo in Expo Go, the folded rail toggle, authenticated sidebar, search type picker and partial/full-open layouts were exercised. On the browser Home page, Explore expanded and collapsed. Accessibility, responsive browser states and Android runtime remain unverified for this change. Retirement of the web fallback remains dependent on its existing parity and accessibility checks.
- Corner audit: `ReleaseCalendar` floating filter/menu dialogs use a uniform 12-point radius; compact bottom sheets retain rounded tops and square bottoms. Native screenshot verification of those dialogs remains pending.
- Current native refinement: the iOS canvas changes its target frame with the drawer toggle and uses one native layout animation for both the drawer and canvas. Shared mobile Sidebar hides Appearance on native and browser; shared `Reveal` retains its children through height transitions, while the Explore panel overlays media-type rows within the sidebar viewport so its options can use the full available height and scroll when needed. Opening Explore does not scroll the underlying navigation. Native Sidebar uses 44-point rows and a 25-point top inset; the search field centers on the camera cutout and the Home highlight shares its vertical position. `NativeRoot` measures horizontal insets at the native screen while retaining the navigator's vertical insets. The foreground shell applies those insets to the drawer, Search and page content. Sidebar's 16-point margin and Search and Screen's 22-point margin subtract the corresponding safe-area inset, avoiding extra padding beside the rail while retaining spacing at the opposite edge. The edge trait and fold posture drive rail presentation; reserved regions remain for fold layout. On a physical iOS 27.2 Duo in Expo Go, the screen-scoped insets changed from 84/0 to 0/84 and back to 84/0 as Floppy moved between sides, and the open/closed sidebar and Search were inspected against Claude. The partially open and closed poses were observed; a direct side swap without the intermediate full-screen state and separate portrait/landscape interaction checks remain unverified. Browser interaction for this change, Android runtime, VoiceOver and Android theme adaptation remain unverified.
- Fold transitions: the iOS shell animates drawer and canvas geometry in either direction between fully and partially open, respecting Reduce Motion. On a physical Duo in Expo Go, both posture changes triggered the animation and reached their expected layouts; motion accessibility was not exercised. Browser and Android runtime were not exercised for this refinement.
- Explore overlay: the shared Sidebar gives unpinned entries a separate layer above the primary navigation, sized to its contents and capped to the available height with scrolling. It closes when the last entry is pinned. The chevron points up when closed and down when open. On a physical iOS 27.2 Duo in Expo Go, all seven entries were visible and the content-sized panel left navigation visible above it; browser and Android interaction and screen-reader checks remain outstanding.
- Native readiness: `Primitives`. The shared `Sidebar` and `TopBar` use React Native presentation; platform adapters provide navigation behavior. The Expo iOS toolbar and adaptive layout remain subject to the runtime checks above.
- Navigation continuity: `frontend/settings/island-reveal.css` no longer hides `[data-sidebar-root]` while it mounts. hx-boost swaps the whole body on every navigation, and a hidden fallback blanked the sidebar for 28-600 ms (up to the four-second fail-safe on a slow client) where v26.10.29 never did. The server fallback has the same items, icons and box. `scripts/check_island_reveals.py` lists the sidebar as a visible-fallback root. Browser verification only; no iOS or Android change (native has its own shell).
- Verification: `app.tests.test_sidebar_model` (props, active page, all 95 icons parse), `users.tests.views.test_sidebar_pins` (pins saved per account). Sidebar pin sync across browsers: browser not exercised. Chromium (built-in browser, macOS): the sidebar mounts, Movies is active, Explore opens, pinning Calendar moves it and persists, a pinned list shows under Lists, saved-view reorder mode shows handles, and finishing it saved the new order on the server. A native drag, the delete confirm dialog and a phone-width open and close were not exercised. iOS and Android not tested.
- Validation targets: `src/app/tests/views/test_boosted_navigation.py`; menu/focus parity needs browser observation.

- Update 2026-11-09: saved views show a bullet in the icon column and run full width at the main link's size, so their text lines up with the media type labels on web and Expo. Expo re-reads the navigation each time the menu opens, so saved views made elsewhere appear. Carve-out (commented in `ShellSlot.jsx`): web reveals the saved-views arrow on hover or on the current library, native always shows it because touch has no hover. Evidence: web runtime (Chromium pane, text offsets measured equal) and Expo iOS runtime (Device Hub, iOS 27.2); Android unverified. Row options (the ellipsis menus) open as a dropdown under their button with no scrim on web and Expo, like the preference dropdowns, instead of a dimmed centred modal. The Expo side menu uses the web's `--color-sidebar` colour (`palette.sidebar`). When it is full width the panel itself extends through the safe-area insets (the side rail), so the rail takes the menu colour as part of the same slide, not as a separate recolour. Device checks (Device Hub, iOS 27.2): the settled open menu, the closed state and the Expo dropdown were seen; a mid-slide frame of the final build was not captured. Web-only carve-out (commented in `sidebar.css`): on a phone the server's drawer sits at z-index 10000, above React Native Web's modal layer (9999), so the row-options dropdown opened underneath the menu until a CSS rule lifted the layer that holds one; checked in Chromium at phone width (dropdown above the drawer, outside tap closes, Reorder and Done work, Explore pin menus open). The installed PWA must be reloaded to pick it up. Dropdown sizing: the sidebar row options and the Search media type menu share one size from `frontend/ui/dropdownMetrics.js` (208 wide, 8 radius, 12 by 10 item padding, 14 text) on web and Expo; the Search menu was 128 wide with 8 by 16 padding on both platforms, so web was not consistent before either. The Search menu now scrolls when the window is too short for every media type. Checked on web (measured equal); the Expo menus use the same constants and were not opened on the device (Device Hub taps would not register).
### SETTINGS-CARD — Shared settings card shell

- SettingsCard accepts an optional headingLevel for native Activity section headings; omitted values retain the existing page/access/provider defaults and appearance. ProviderActivityView and the MAL recent-sync card request level 2 to preserve the browser hierarchy. Initial browser comparison exposed level-4 headings; the semantics fix awaits recheck. Current iOS/Android behavior is unverified; existing ownership and retirement conditions remain unchanged.
- Data presentation: `SettingsCard` accepts an optional icon and the explicit `pageCards` palette variants used by native settings adapters (including the 20 px Access frame / 16 px subsection title) and `DataSettingsSlot` for the web page's 24 px frame, 20 px title and 16 px heading spacing. Other card consumers keep their existing appearance. The shared component remains React-owned; browser adapters and retained provider body slots keep their prior owners. Native readiness: `Primitives`. Browser: Data compared at 375x812 in Django and Expo; remaining lower sections are still partial. iOS: Not verified. Android: Not verified.

- Purpose/usage: provider Connection instance/personal credentials and account setup, Import preferences/options, and Metadata library source controls.
- Shared runtime: body responses compare the retained head's loader/CSS versions
  with the current build and reload after a stale boosted navigation. This applies
  to private and public shells without changing existing controls or their owners.
- Implementation: `frontend/settings/SettingsCard.jsx`, shared `Chip.jsx`, `mount.jsx`, `index.js`, `settings-card.css`; `src/users/templatetags/ui_tags.py` and `src/templates/users/components/settings_card.html`. See [usage and ownership](settings-cards.md).
- Contract: one title/badge/help/frame pattern with editable/read-only/neutral and public API tones. `Chip` shares passive/action/link styling across status badges, media pills and the provider-key link, with consistent hover/focus highlights and no text underline. AniList supplies React-owned children; retained partial consumers keep their server body outside the header root. Existing backend permissions and CSRF remain authoritative.
- Data: presentation-only `json_script`; no credentials, server body HTML or transport in the shared React API. Shared source uses React Native primitives; the web adapter supplies DOM events and browser theme values.
- Status: `Web Migrated` shared card presentation. AniList uses full React composition; Audiobookshelf uses reusable account connection and manual-import islands. Other providers retain Django body slots and setup/restore dialogs until their controls are ported. This does not migrate `FORM-CONTROLS` as a whole.
- Native readiness: `Primitives`. `Chip.jsx`, `SettingsCard.jsx` use `react-native` primitives with no browser API; browser behavior is in `mount.jsx`. Not run on iOS or Android; its data still arrives as server-rendered props, not from the API.
- Verification: production assets build and collect through Django; targeted Django/theme tests passed. Chromium 151/macOS browser checks cover initial/HTMX/back-forward lifecycle, focus, real CSRF submissions, fallback, responsive widths and six theme states. iOS/Android not tested; no native compatibility claim.
- Related work: [#1793](https://github.com/dannyvfilms/Floppy/issues/1793); user-authorized first React browser component pilot.
- Deferrals: server-owned form bodies retire through scoped control ports after parity checks; native acceptance awaits actual iOS/Android runs and a native theme/transport boundary. Broader performance evidence remains required before larger component adoption.

### FORM-CONTROLS — Fields, popovers, dialogs and feedback

- Modal presentation is React-owned through shared `Modal` and `ModalCloseButton`, with `RailModalProvider` and `RailModalHost` in the Duo shell. Existing shared dialogs, action hosts, pickers, filters, calendar/statistics sheets, sidebar menus, media/collection/history/list forms, bulk menus, tooltips, the barcode scanner and music dialogs consume this boundary. On a supported iOS rail device, dialogs stay inside the app canvas, the rail menu action becomes Close for the topmost dialog, and their header X is hidden. Other iOS devices, Android and web retain RN Modal and their inline close controls. Existing body ownership and retirement conditions remain unchanged; this does not port missing forms or transport. Runtime verification for the new modal path is pending.
- `AdaptivePresentationSheet` is an Expo UI BottomSheet adapter for iOS, Android and Expo Web. It supplies half/full snap points, a grabber, and an optional left-aligned header with a 16-point horizontal inset and a Liquid Glass close control on iOS. Android and web use a conventional surface because Liquid Glass is iOS-specific. On iOS the sheet body uses a reduced horizontal safe-area inset to clear the Duo rail, while the close control can occupy it; the native sheet background retains its geometry. Callers control presentation, dismissal, content and theme. Android supports half/full states rather than arbitrary precise heights. A physical iPhone Duo rendered the preview in Expo Go; its owner reports expected behavior across several positions. Browser and Android runtime verification remain pending.
- The iOS sheet close control uses a 48-point glass target to align with Duo rail controls; Android and web retain their 44-point controls. Verify each platform independently when changing this platform-specific sizing.
- The sheet header centers its title and close control vertically in an 80-point row, lowering both beneath the grabber. The updated iOS layout was inspected on a physical Duo; Android and web rendering remain unverified.
- Detail action-row overlays in Expo now use `AdaptivePresentationSheet`: links, tracking, tags, notes, lists, activity history, Seerr, More, tracking actions, cover and edition. Their sheet background uses the sidebar theme token. Links use the same grouped source and external-link data as web Detail; web retains its existing popup because this change targets Expo. Their existing shared form components remain presentation owners. Progress and other collection-screen dialogs remain on `Modal`, which can retire only after those consumers migrate. Physical Duo inspection covered links, tracking, notes, tags, lists and More to Cover; other actions, browser and Android runtime verification remain pending. The embedded Tags form retains its own heading below the sheet title.
- The Expo Detail Collection add action embeds the shared `CollectionCopyDialog` in `AdaptivePresentationSheet`; the Collection screen and web retain their existing dialog until migrated. `DropdownMenu` is the shared anchored sidebar/options surface, and `SelectField` can opt into it and accept multiple values. The sheet hosts nested dialogs locally, and the native modal host separates its registration context from active-dialog updates to prevent render loops. Physical Duo: Collection sheet opened and a Format option was selected; sidebar regression, multi-select, browser and Android runtime remain unverified. These components remain partially/coexisting owned until their remaining consumers migrate and platform verification is complete.

- Purpose/usage: repeated buttons, inputs/selectors/tabs, confirmations, help/errors and notifications across forms, settings, filters and modals.
- Implementation: [app-wide React controls](react-components.md), `frontend/ui/controls` and `controls.css`, consumed by provider Overview/Connection/Import/Activity. Legacy consumers include inline templates, `src/templates/users/components/info_tip.html`, `form_save_bar.html`, allauth fields, base modal/toast infrastructure and `src/static/js/keepPopupsOnScreen.js`.
- The shared `TextField` keeps URL fields on one line, supports a configurable trailing-control inset, and does not force a line-height on large native inputs so placeholder and entered text use the platform's natural vertical metrics. The auth server field uses one trailing action: local discovery when the address is empty, connection check when it is present, and clear when it has an error. Discovery reports searching, unavailable, and no-results states visibly. In Remote mode, its info control sits beside the Server address label, with the smaller field-group gap used by other form rows.
- `TextField` accepts an optional `onSubmitEditing`; the sign-in password field in `AuthEntrance` uses it so Return submits, as the web form does. Browser: checked in the Expo web build, native-variant preview. iOS: Not verified. Android: Not verified.
- Contract: labels, selected/disabled/busy states, errors/CSRF, click-away/Escape and existing focus behavior, viewport-safe popups, dirty-save live announcements. A universal modal focus trap is not established.
- Interaction parity (#1878): shared provider cards retain an immediate 1px themed outline on hover (2px keyboard focus), while shared link chips suppress browser anchor underlines without hiding their link semantics. Dialog help tests explicitly dismiss their modal tooltip before operating underlying fields.
- Statistics browser contract (#1878): shared statistics hero, summary cards, and status chart/legend expose stable test IDs so tests continue checking totals, text overflow, scrolling and navigation rather than retired Django CSS wrappers.
- File-import event ownership (#1878): the browser file import subscribes to preference-change events at the shared page boundary instead of assuming the presence of an Alpine ancestor; React and SSR upload paths now both receive live values.
- Browser parity (#1878): the CLZ import-preferences web adapter now synchronizes hidden fallback POST fields even without an Alpine ancestor, preserving saved override mode and wishlist choices when the file-upload chunk is blocked. App tracking browser tests exercise the mounted shared global-search control.
- Link contracts (#1878): browser-only `href` / `hrefAttrs` for overview cards, credential key URLs, and file-import websites now come from provider web mounts via neutral props. Native consumers continue using their `onPress` handlers.
- Island loader regression (#1878): the browser host selector now includes the shell sidebar, global search, track form, and statistics roots that already had renderer branches but had become unreachable. Shared presentation and native semantics remain unchanged.
- Browser regression repair (#1878): `Modal.web.jsx` explicitly forwards Escape dismissal to the current modal owner, and the credential dialog now uses that shared boundary without changing iOS/Android behavior. Shared `Tooltip` bubbles expose the accessible tooltip role; the credential-access dialog exposes its purpose through a dialog role and name. `FeatureList` copy has a stable semantic test target, and the catalog pin exposes its toggle state with `aria-pressed`. These are compatibility/accessibility fixes, not new navigation or data ownership.
- Data: owning Django forms/errors/messages, Alpine state and response events; feature endpoints retain action semantics.
- Reuse/blockers: use shared `SelectField` for preference forms and `FilterDropdown` for Lists-style filter toolbars. Both share keyboard/typeahead/dismissal behavior but retain distinct appearances. Legacy dropdowns remain inline until their UI is reworked; native behavior still needs proof.
- Scrolling rows: `ScrollRow` in `controls.jsx` is the one horizontal scroll container for tabs and chip filters (no wrap, hidden scrollbar, a fade on the side with more to see, the selected child scrolled into view). `Tabs` (provider pages) and `FilterChips` (Discover media types, mounted by `mountFilterChips.jsx` from the page's Alpine `selectedMedia` and `switchMedia`) both use it. Other wrapping chip rows (details, person and studio pages, tags) are not migrated and keep their markup.
- Validation targets: owning feature tests, `src/users/tests/views/test_preferences.py`; general accessibility interaction coverage unverified.
- Status: `Partial / coexisting`. The shared React controls (buttons, labeled fields/selects, chips/toggle chips, tabs, dialogs, card grids, `Spinner`, `Badge`, `ActionMenu`, `ScrollRow`) are mounted throughout the provider pages and AniList; see BUTTON, BADGE and SPINNER for their template adapters and remaining consumers. Every other consumer (inline templates, `info_tip.html`, `form_save_bar.html`, allauth fields, base modal and toast infrastructure) keeps legacy controls until reworked. Reuse these components by element, without requiring a whole provider/page port. Provider-specific authentication and transport remain in feature code.
- Native readiness: `DOM`. Its presentation (`controls.jsx`, 377 lines) is React DOM with CSS classes and has 24 browser-API references; a rewrite to `react-native` primitives is owed before native.
- Verification: both provider Connection dialogs opened and dismissed with Escape, including focus return and setup-dialog Tab/Shift+Tab wrapping, in Chromium 151 on macOS at 1440×1000 and 390×844 in system light and dark. Native and assistive-technology testing not performed.
- Verification: 17 Chromium tests pass across all AniList tabs, six theme states and phone/tablet/desktop widths. Public/private switching via pointer and keyboard preserves entered username and existing credential gating; surface borders, inset arrows and purple actions are checked in light/dark. Shared toggle/dialog/link chips show focus rings for keyboard navigation only; dialog focus restoration is preserved. Native and assistive-technology verification remain pending.
- Related work: [provider consolidation #1793](https://github.com/dannyvfilms/Floppy/issues/1793). Broader legacy adoption follows component redesigns; the shared browser controls are available now.

### TOKENS — Theme, typography, motion and icons

System theme resolution uses the React Native-supported `auto` override on iOS and Android, avoiding the Android null-argument startup failure while continuing to follow the operating system. Explicit light/dark, presets and custom themes retain their values. Web CSS resolution and its guarded Appearance adapter are unchanged. Theme logic tests cover both system schemes and valid platform overrides; runtime evidence is recorded separately from complete theme/state acceptance.

- Native custom theme effects: surface and panel opacity resolve through colour tokens; runtime radius consumers use the saved radius, while module-level static styles still retain their initial radius. Real backdrop blur is blocked by the installed primitives: their filter blurs children and no backdrop-blur dependency is installed. Reopen when a native backdrop implementation is available and static styles can consume live radii. Browser effect comparison pending; iOS and Android not verified.
- Purpose/usage: all surfaces' visual system.
- Status: `Existing (no UI work needed)`. Shared theme, typography, motion and icon foundation that every React and legacy surface reads; not a component to port.
- Implementation: `src/static/css/input.css`, generated `main.css`, `src/templates/app/icons/`, bundled fonts, `src/users/appearance.py`; Tailwind 4/CSS variables.
- Contract: explicit presets/custom and system light/dark, accent contrast, responsive layout and reduced motion; follow [theming](../architecture/theming.md).
- Data: user appearance configuration, media vocabulary in `src/app/config.py`, existing Tailwind build.
- Reuse/blockers: share semantic values; native font metrics, SVG, CSS units/selectors and safe areas require explicit equivalents. No independent palette.
- Validation targets: `src/app/tests/test_theme_tokens.py`, `src/users/tests/views/test_appearance.py`; native visual/accessibility checks outstanding.

### ARTWORK-LOADING — Image loading and fallback

- Purpose/usage: cards, rails, posters/backdrops and detail images.
- Status: `Legacy`. Image loading is plain JavaScript (`artwork-loading.js`, lazySizes); no React component.
- Implementation: `src/static/js/artwork-loading.js`, `image-fallback.js`, lazySizes; `src/templates/app/components/home_artwork_poller.html` is the deferred shelf consumer.
- Contract: no blank/broken art, preserved aspect/fallback provenance, lazy/deferred refresh; display fallback does not overwrite stored artwork.
- Data: server artwork projection/cache URLs and Home cover state in `src/app/views.py`.
- Reuse/blockers: image states/geometry reusable; observers/error hooks/polling are web adapters. Preserve [cover security](../architecture/local-covers.md).
- Validation targets: `src/app/tests/test_media_card_contract.py`, `src/app/tests/test_game_artwork.py`; native caching unverified.

### ASYNC-STATE — Cache/loading refresh lifecycle

- Purpose/usage: Discover, History and Statistics refresh/pending/error state.
- Status: `Legacy`. Plain JavaScript pollers and HTMX fragments; no React component.
- Implementation: `src/static/js/cache-updater.js`, owning inline template pollers/HTMX fragments.
- Contract: bounded retries/timeouts, offline/online recovery, exit cleanup and useful stale/error/loading display without duplicate pollers.
- Data: cache-status endpoint in `src/app/views.py`, feature task/cache state.
- Reuse/blockers: potentially share transitions; browser lifecycle/task transport need adapters. This is not offline synchronization.
- Validation targets: `src/static/js/cache-updater.selfcheck.mjs`, owning feature tests; native background behavior unverified.

### SPINNER — Loading ring

- Purpose/usage: the small spinning ring shown while an HTMX search, infinite-scroll page or library lookup is in flight.
- Status: `Web Migrated` on every consumer that used the legacy `animate-spin rounded-full border-b-2` ring (16 `{% spinner %}` sites in 12 templates, plus the React header search). Browser verification: built-in browser at desktop and phone width, light and dark, on the list page (3 rings) and the Movies library page; ring size, colour, border, position and 1s linear animation compared numerically with the legacy markup; HTMX-swapped markup mounts. Native iOS and Android: not verified.
- Native readiness: `DOM`. Its presentation (`controls.jsx`, 377 lines) is React DOM with CSS classes and has 24 browser-API references; a rewrite to `react-native` primitives is owed before native.
- Implementation: shared `Spinner` in `frontend/ui/controls` (`.ui-spinner` in `controls.css`; `size` in px, `tone` accent, muted or white; decorative, `aria-hidden`), `frontend/ui/mountSpinner.jsx` web adapter registered as `data-spinner-root` in `frontend/settings/index.js`, and the `{% spinner size tone %}` tag (`users/templatetags/ui_tags.py`, `users/components/spinner.html`). The server markup inside the host is the same ring, so it is the fallback if the module fails. The host is `display: contents`, so it adds no box. A host nested inside another island (the header search form) is skipped by the loader; that island renders its own `Spinner`.
- Consumers: Movies/library list, Collection list, Person filmography, List detail (search indicators and load-more), Smart list detail, Custom lists hub, Smart rules builder, Add item, Recommend item, Library move panel and its results, header barcode scan (React `GlobalSearch` and `base.html` fallback). Public list pages use `base_public.html`, which loads the same island bundle.
- Left on legacy, with reopening condition: `users/about.html` (SVG ring with its own look; reopen when About is migrated), `progress_changer.html` (icon swapped by `htmx-indicator`; reopen with the quick progress bar), and the Alpine `:class="{ 'animate-spin': loading }"` refresh icons in detail action buttons, music album/artist pages, Discover and Statistics (they rotate an icon, not a ring; reopen when those buttons are ported).
- Native mapping: `ActivityIndicator`; the contract is `size` and `tone` only.
- Validation: `users.tests.test_spinner_tag`, `lists`, targeted template views.

### BADGE — Pill label

- Purpose/usage: the small rounded label for genres, release types, statuses and flags.
- Status: `Partial / coexisting`. 21 static pill sites in 15 templates listed under Consumers are on the shared `Badge`; the remaining legacy pills below stay hand-written. Browser verification: built-in browser, 14 legacy variants rendered beside the shared badge in a throwaway comparison page across all 12 theme states (system, light, dark, Catppuccin Mocha, Dracula, Nord, Gruvbox, OLED, Glass, Plex, Projector, Video Store): 0 style differences (background, text colour, border, padding, font size, line height, weight, wrapping), size within 0.03 px, same position. Real pages checked at desktop and phone width in light, dark, Glass and Catppuccin Mocha: Movies table Genres column and onboarding Metadata. Not seen on screen: release notes (needs GitHub), music album detail, podcast show, track and secondary genre blocks, add/recommend previews, the arr library panel, Seerr request status and the metadata mapping panel (covered by the comparison page and the tag tests only). Native iOS and Android: not verified.
- Native readiness: `DOM`. Its presentation (`controls.jsx`, 377 lines) is React DOM with CSS classes and has 24 browser-API references; a rewrite to `react-native` primitives is owed before native.
- Implementation: shared `Badge` in `frontend/ui/controls` (`.ui-badge` in `controls.css`; `size` xs, sm, md or tag; `tone` indigo, rose, violet, neutral, outline, tint, genre, green-soft, indigo-soft, emerald-soft or amber-soft; plain-text `label`; optional local `href` for genre links; `nowrap`), `frontend/ui/mountBadge.jsx` web adapter registered as `data-badge-root` in `frontend/settings/index.js`, and the `{% badge label size tone href= nowrap= %}` tag (`users/templatetags/ui_tags.py`, `users/components/badge.html`). The label is text only, never markup; `href` is accepted only when it starts with `/` or `?`. The server markup inside the host is the same pill, so it is the fallback if the module fails. The host is `display: contents`, so it adds no box (a consumer that needs a layout class on the pill, such as `ml-auto`, wraps the tag in its own element). A host nested inside another island is skipped by the loader and keeps the server pill.
- Consumers: genre tags on podcast show, music artist, album and track detail, episode details and the detail secondary content block (links); the library table Genres cell (links, `nowrap`); music album type, year and media-type pills; list add and recommend previews (violet genres); arr library request status; Seerr request status; release notes Installed and Newer than yours; onboarding Metadata suggestion badge; metadata mapping status (Mapped, Mapping needed).
- Left on legacy, with reopening condition: music album codec, bitrate and channels pills (they hold an SVG icon, which cannot be passed as props; reopen when `Badge` gets an icon slot from the shared icon set); `media_metadata_panel.html` source pill (11px, `py-0.5`, one site; reopen with the metadata panel port); `calendar_list.html` Today pill (`text-sm` with `px-2`, one site; reopen with Calendar); person and studio filter links, `tag_index.html` and `discover.html` chips (links or buttons that belong to the filter chip family); `episode_row`, `detail_episode_track_button`, `detail_episode_collection_button` (action buttons); `detail_tag_preview.html` (tag colours come from stored tag data as class strings); `game_lengths_section.html` (hover and tracked-letter variant); `episode_ordering.html` and `match_fix.html` (state-dependent classes); `oauth_applications.html`, `progress_breakdown.html` (uppercase micro-label), `appearance.html` (segmented buttons). Each reopens when its page is ported or when its variant is added to `Badge`.
- Native mapping: a `View` with `Text`; the contract is `label`, `size`, `tone`.
- Validation: `users.tests.test_badge_tag`, `app.tests.test_music_genres`, `app.tests.views.test_podcast_show_detail`, `app.tests.views.test_music_release_views`, `app.tests.views.test_media_details`, `users.tests.test_release_notes`, `users.tests.views.test_onboarding`, `integrations.tests.test_arr_library`, `lists.tests.test_views`, `app.tests.test_templatetags`, `npm run check:ui`.

### BUTTON — Solid action button

- Portable `Button` supports an optional palette size; explicit size takes precedence and the existing web default remains small. Native provider/setup adapters use medium buttons and theme control radii. Browser comparison identified the earlier height/radius mismatch; the opt-in fix awaits the final comparison. Historical Android rendering evidence does not verify this new size path; current iOS/Android interaction verification remains open. Browser adapters and legacy consumers retire only with their owning forms.
- Purpose/usage: the solid indigo (primary) or red (danger) button, the surface "Load more" button and the red text button that templates used to write by hand for form saves, submits and the odd htmx action.
- Status: `Partial / coexisting`. 65 sites in 22 templates are on the shared `Button` (61 plain or form-submit, 4 htmx: the two History Load more branches and two history Delete buttons in the song and podcast track modal, `fill_track_song.html`); 211 hand-written solid indigo or red `<button>` tags remain in 87 templates, among 1,125 `<button>` tags in all (counted by `python3 scripts/ui_migration_metrics.py`). Browser verification: built-in browser against an isolated database, with the pre-change build served from a clean checkout of HEAD on another port. Eight legacy variants were rendered next to the shared tag output and mounted by React in all 13 theme states (system, light, dark, Catppuccin Mocha, Dracula, Nord, Gruvbox, OLED, Glass, Plex, Projector, Video Store, custom): 0 differences in background, text colour, border width, radius, padding, font, line height, weight, cursor, width or height. Real pages at 1280 px and 390 px: Media Cards (Save), Account, Lists and History compared button by button with the old build (same position and size to 0.01 px). Clicked on screen: the migrated History Load more (htmx `GET /history/day/...` 200, the day swapped exactly as on the old build) and the Media Cards Save (a form submit: `POST /settings/cards/tv` 302). Not seen on screen: every modal or tab-state button (the Authenticator and recovery codes forms in Account, the Trakt, Jellyfin, MAL, reading-server and provider credential forms, onboarding steps, collection, track notes, match fix, OAuth device), the track-modal history Delete buttons, which are covered by the tag tests and the template tests only. Native iOS and Android: not verified.
- Native readiness: `Primitives`. Portable Button uses React Native primitives and theme-token palettes; browser semantics remain in adapters and remaining legacy form consumers retain their current owners. The current opt-in size path has no iOS/Android runtime verification.
- Implementation: shared `Button` in `frontend/ui/controls` (`.ui-button` in `controls.css`; the existing `danger` and `secondary` props are unchanged; new `tone` danger-solid, danger-deep, surface or ghost-danger, `small` for text-sm, `auto` to fit the label and `flat` for no border), `frontend/ui/mountButton.jsx` web adapter registered as `data-button-root` in `frontend/settings/index.js`, and the `{% button label tone size width submit= disabled= %}` tag (`users/templatetags/ui_tags.py`, `users/components/button.html`). The label is plain text, translated with `_("...")`. Allowed attributes pass through unchanged: `id`, `name`, `value`, `form`, `formaction`, `title` and any `hx_*`, `data_*` or `aria_*` (written with `_`, rendered with `-`; `hx-on*` is refused because it runs inline script). The server markup inside the host is the same `<button>`, so a form submit still submits and htmx still works if the script fails. The host is `display: contents`, so it adds no box. When React replaces the button it calls `htmx.process` on the host so htmx binds the new node. A host nested inside another island is skipped by the loader and keeps the server button. Radius follows `--theme-radius` and transition timing follows the theme motion tokens, as the old utility classes did. Keyboard focus keeps the browser's default ring, as the old buttons did; the shared 2px indigo ring stays on the AniList and provider buttons.
- Consumers: Account (authenticator and recovery codes, delete account), Media Cards settings, Custom lists (Trakt credentials, import), Provider settings bodies (`provider_import.html`: Connect, Sync now, Disconnect, Save and add-instance forms), Jellyfin and MAL sync, instance and personal credentials, TMDB proxy, reading-server modal, media type provider modal, onboarding (media types, metadata, import status, connect Trakt), OAuth device, match fix, collection modal and entry summary, music track notes, History "Load more" (htmx), track-modal history Delete in `fill_track_song.html` (htmx, ghost red).
- Left on legacy, with reopening condition:
  - Buttons with Alpine bindings (`@click`, `x-show`, `:class`, `:disabled`; 872 tags): the host carries `x-ignore`, and Alpine attribute names such as `@click` cannot be set from React. Reopen when the owning dialog or toolbar is ported so its state lives in React, or when the adapter gets an event contract.
  - Buttons that htmx swaps in place of themselves (`hx-swap="outerHTML"` on the button: the list and tag Add/Remove toggles): htmx would replace a React-managed node. Reopen with a React toggle that owns its own request.
  - Buttons with an SVG or an included icon (solid ones and every icon-only button): an icon cannot be passed as props. Reopen when `Button` gets an icon slot from the shared icon set.
  - Buttons whose attribute values need template composition (`formaction="{% url ... %}?next=..."` in the album, artist and podcast track modals and list form, `form=` in the episode watch row) or whose label is state-dependent markup (`{% if tracker %}Update{% else %}Add{% endif %}`, "Add instance" and "Sync now" variants in `provider_import.html`, `fill_track.html`, `fill_track_song.html`, onboarding services): reopen when the adapter accepts composed attributes, or when those forms are ported.
  - Look variants not yet in `Button`: sizes with `h-10`, `w-48` or `flex-1` (Connect buttons in `provider_import.html`), `rounded-lg` with `hover:bg-indigo-500`, `text-xs` compact buttons, the tracker Delete (red when a tracker exists, grey when not), the segmented buttons in `appearance.html`, tab and chip buttons. Each reopens when its variant is added or its page is ported.
  - Links styled as buttons: none migrated; `Button` already renders an anchor when given `href`.
- Native mapping: a `Pressable` with a `Text`; the contract is `label`, `tone`, `size`, `width`, `submit` and `disabled`.
- Validation: `users.tests.test_button_tag`, the targeted template views listed in the change summary, `npm run check:ui`.

### WEB-UTILITIES — Clipboard, installation and static service worker

- Purpose/usage: copy controls, install feedback and cached static assets.
- Status: `Legacy`. The copy control, install hooks and service worker are plain JavaScript and web-only by nature; no React component.
- Implementation: `src/static/js/copy-item.js`, `serviceworker.js`, install hooks in `base.html` and `users/about.html`.
- Contract: feedback/availability, cache version/cleanup and request/auth boundaries. Static caching does not provide offline tracking.
- Data: DOM values, browser capabilities, service worker route in `src/app/views.py`.
- Reuse/blockers: copy intent shareable; install/service worker stay web-specific. Assess explicit exceptions when migrating a consumer.
- Validation targets: `src/app/tests/views/test_service_worker.py`, `src/users/tests/views/test_about_install_integration.py`.
- Browser evidence: native About > Open Utilities > Copy Server URL copied the exact connected 8090 address successfully, then the prior clipboard was restored. The paired WEB About surface exposes static-cache utilities, so the platform-specific scopes remain Partial. No iOS/Android runtime verification is implied.

### ERRORS-DOCS — Error/recovery and API documentation pages

- Purpose/usage: 400/403/CSRF/404/500 and API documentation surfaces.
- Status: `Partial / coexisting`. Server error documents and API documentation retain their no-JavaScript contract. Shared `ErrorRecovery` and `ErrorReportPanel` provide React Native presentation for interactive/native recovery; browser and native adapters keep platform behavior separate.
- Native readiness: `Primitives`. Shared recovery/traceback presentation uses React Native primitives; browser diagnostic controls stay in adapters.
- Implementation: root error templates, `src/templates/includes/error_report_panel.html`, `src/templates/api/docs.html`.
- Contract: safe diagnostic/report text, useful recovery links, permission boundaries and usable error documents without normal context or loaded app JS.
- Data: `src/app/error_views.py`, error context and API schema routes.
- Reuse/blockers: error presentation shareable; server error documents/API explorer are web surfaces.
- Validation targets: error view tests under `src/app/tests/`; interactive/native parity unverified.

- Native resolution: `ErrorReportPanel.native.jsx` explicitly imports shared traceback presentation from `ErrorReportPanel.jsx`, preventing recursive self-resolution when recovery mounts. The existing wrapper and layout are unchanged. This applies to iOS and Android; web already resolves its separate adapter and needs no corresponding change. Native-priority dependency tests pass; error-screen runtime rendering remains separately unverified.
- Remaining consumers/retirement: root error templates and the API explorer remain server-owned because they must work without normal app JavaScript. Shared recovery does not retire those fallbacks. Browser, iOS and Android verification are recorded independently.

## Library, discovery and media presentation

### MEDIA-CARD — Canonical card and metadata lines

Shared MediaCard preserves the accepted status-specific icon shapes and colors, with provider icons as a fallback for unknown statuses. Native action hosts and progress renderers remain supplied by adapters. Ownership and remaining server consumers are unchanged; browser and native verification are recorded independently.

- PeopleScreen consumes canonical person/studio credit models through MediaCardSlot and the opt-in `shouldShowMediaCardLine` / `shouldShowMediaCardCorner` hover metadata policy; dormant lines remain visible at rest and runtime/count chips wait for reveal. Existing web adapter ownership and other consumers remain unchanged. Browser: final Person check confirmed the outlined Completed icon and no runtime overlap; minor title truncation and toolbar spacing remain. Studio navigation, badge, count and layout checked. Native readiness: `Primitives`; iOS and Android not verified. Retirement requires the remaining web fallbacks to adopt the shared card contract.
- Purpose/usage: library, Home, related, search, Discover, lists, collection, credits and tier/group surfaces.
- Implementation: `src/templates/app/components/media_card.html`, `card_lines.html`, `media_card_list.html`, `src/app/card_surfaces.py`, template tags.
- Contract: declared surface/tag, viewer rating/status, aspect ratios, obfuscation, hover/touch actions, public/read-only/bulk states and stable OOB status wrappers.
- Data: `media_list_entries_for_items`, surface flags, card configuration and server projections.
- Reuse/blockers: highest leverage; [media-card contract](../architecture/media-card.md) authoritative. Replace consumers and response slots, never create an unrelated second card system.
- Status: `Web Migrated` for every card the `media_card` tag, `history_card_react` and `media_row_react` render. All 15 surfaces in `card_surfaces.py` set `react_card=True`; History (`history_card.html`) and the Search list row (`media_card_list.html`) use the same `MediaCard.jsx` (poster, square, landscape and `layout: row`). The artwork link, corner chips, progress bar, title and alternate-title tooltip, subtitle lines (including a credit's role line), status chip, rating button with its star popup, hover buttons (track, lists, history, Discover plan and hide, list reorder and drag handle), touch tap-to-reveal and bulk-select checkbox are all React (`MediaCard.jsx`, `mountMediaCard.jsx`, model in `media_card_model.py`). The track and lists popups open in the page's one React host (`ModalHost.jsx`); the cards carry no Alpine and no popup markup. `media_card.html` is a shell: the card wrapper classes (themes and title settings still key off them), the props `<script>`, and a first-paint poster and title link inside the React host that React replaces on mount. The legacy server body, its Alpine fallback and the empty status, overlay and rating slots are deleted. `app.tests.test_media_card_contract.MediaCardInventoryTest` fails if a surface opts out of React, if the template regrows a legacy body, or if any template draws `media-card` markup that is neither the tag nor a documented exception.
- Playback uses the shared list-item MediaCard with a 16:9 artwork area. Its section heading and manual-check-in controls sit above the card; the title is the show/movie and one subtitle line carries the episode title and current play time. `mediaCardGridWidth` and `playbackCardWidth` provide responsive sizing: three compact mobile cards use the shared 110 pt width plus two 16 pt Home-rail gaps; comfortable mobile uses two 168 pt cards plus a 12 pt gap; desktop uses two library-grid cards plus a 12 pt gap. The native card scrim uses a continuous SVG gradient rather than stepped opacity bands.
- Now Playing uses the same indigo fill as standard MediaCards for both playing and paused/stale states, so its progress color does not switch to the playback warning color. The latest color change has not been verified in a reloaded Device Hub build; browser and Android runtime verification remain pending.
- Native readiness: `Primitives`. The native presentation in `MediaCard.jsx` uses React Native primitives and takes card data/handlers as props; browser transport, htmx, and legacy DOM slot behavior stay in `MediaCard.web.jsx` and its mount adapters. Native poster cards now use the server-projected `actions.clickable` preference: hidden actions make the first touch open the card, while shown actions retain tap-to-reveal. The `shouldRevealMediaCardActions` policy is shared logic. Expo Settings > Media Card reads and writes the same `clickable_media_cards` account preference; per-type native profile editing remains local demo state. Device Hub iOS 27.2 / Expo Go runtime opened Settings > Media Cards and showed both touch-action choices; with the local proof card's `actions.clickable: true`, the first tap opened its detail. The Expo proof session had no server account, so preference load/save and the `clickable: false` reveal-then-open path remain unverified on device. Android runtime remains unverified.
- Corner chip sizing: the play/status badge and next-episode chip now share an explicit 24px height on native and web. The iPhone Duo compact Home view was checked after hot reload and shows both chips at matching heights. Compact behavior remains `Next` on narrow cards and `Next ep` on wider cards; the next-episode link keeps its full `Jump to next episode` accessible name. Browser runtime and Android verification for this sizing adjustment remain pending.
- Remaining consumers and retirement: (1) Bulk select is read from the page's Alpine scope (`selectMode`, `isItemSelected`, `toggleItemSelected`) by `mountMediaCard.jsx`. The bulk toolbar and dialogs are React (BULK) but still read the same Alpine selection state (`bulkSelection.js`, published as `window.__bulkSelection`). It retires when selection moves into a shared store that both the cards and the toolbar read; reopen when someone takes that. (2) The save and score responses still send server fragments out of band (`media_card_status_chip.html`, `media_card_rating_oob.html`) for pages that render those slots; a React card ignores the swap (`data-react-owned`) and updates from `floppyCardUpdate`. They retire with the detail-page chips. (3) Documented exceptions that are different kinds of card, not this one: person and cast cards, Statistics highlights and the repeat-player strip, the server-rendered Now Playing fallback, list index cards, and the music album and artist grids (they need an Album or Artist, not an Item). They are listed with reasons in `DOCUMENTED_EXCEPTIONS` in the contract test; reopen if a media item is ever drawn there. (4) The Search list row keeps its `meta` slot (server-rendered per-type metadata) inside the React host.
- Browser verification (Chromium, built-in browser pane and Playwright, macOS, throwaway database and test login): Library grid (movie, game, book), Home, History, Collection, custom list grid, tier board and list table at desktop (1024 and 1280) and phone (375 and 390) widths, light and dark (system theme driven by the OS setting, plus the explicit `light` and `dark` classes). Before and after builds compared on 36 surface, width and theme combinations: 0.0% differing pixels and identical card geometry on all 36; the only DOM differences are the removed empty slot wrappers and the timing of the async release-year fill. Interactions exercised: tracker popup open and save with live card refresh, lists popup add, rating popup and score change, touch tap-to-reveal, bulk select, status chip and no native `<select>` in any card. Not exercised in a browser (no provider network in the test setup): Search (card and list row), Discover and hidden Discover, detail-page related and seasons cards, credit and group surfaces, modal search picker, list recommendations, smart lists, the media-type chip and alternative-title tooltip on a real title. Those are covered by `app.tests.test_media_card_contract` and `test_media_card_model`, which render every surface. Other theme presets (Dracula, Nord, Gruvbox, OLED, Glass, Custom) were not opened. This native preference change does not alter the browser adapter; browser runtime for this revision was not rerun. Device Hub iOS 27.2 / Expo Go: Settings > Media Cards rendered with both choices; a local proof card with `actions.clickable: true` opened detail on first tap. No server session was available, so native preference load/save and the false-value reveal-then-open path were not device-verified. Android runtime remains unverified.
- Update 2026-11-09: native status chips draw the web's SVG shapes through the shared `Icon` contract (`frontend/ui/statusChipIcons.js`) instead of text glyphs, so they centre and match the web; Home cards now carry the status colour class; the poster no longer lifts on hover; the poster progress bar honours the always-visible setting on the React card.
- Validation targets: `src/app/tests/test_media_card_contract.py`, `src/app/tests/test_media_card_model.py`; complete native/consumer matrix outstanding.
- Web parity pass against v26.10.29: the card model now carries the status `colorClass` (the chip icon had lost its colour) and the poster progress bar's `dormant` flag (the bar was stuck at opacity 0 until hover). Collection cards use the `grid` variant and a CSS grid like the release `.media-grid`. Browser verified against the v26.10.29 tag at 1440 and 390; iOS and Android not verified.

### POPUP-HOST — Shared popup host, Add-to-lists form and Track form

- Purpose/usage: one host (`ModalHost.jsx`, mounted once from `base.html`) opens the popups that tracking actions need. Callers send a `floppy-open-modal` event with `{modal, url, vals, target, labels}`.
- Implementation: `frontend/ui/ModalHost.web.jsx`, `ListsForm.jsx`, `modal-forms.css`; `lists_modal_spec` in `src/app/media_card_model.py`; the `lists_modal_click` template tag in `app_tags.py`.
- Contract: `lists_modal` answers `?format=json` with a form model (item, lists with `hasItem` and tags, tag list, toggle URL, CSRF token); `list_item_toggle` with `format=json` answers `{success, hasItem}` or `{success:false, error}` (403 smart list, 404 stranger, 500/503 failure). Permissions, smart-list rule, retries, activity log and error text stay in the views. Labels travel in the open event, translated by the server.
- Status: `Partial / coexisting`. The Add-to-lists form is React-owned (`ListsForm.jsx` with `SelectField`, `Button`, `Spinner`; its own overlay with `role=dialog`, Escape, overlay click, focus into the dialog and back). Consumers moved to the host: the card hover button (grid, History, Search row) and 10 legacy buttons (`detail_action_buttons`, `detail_row_actions`, `detail_music_album`, `detail_music_track_actions`, `music_album_detail`, `episode_details`, `comic_issue_details`, `podcast_episode_list`, `history_card`, `media_card_list`). Their private Alpine `listsOpen` popups are deleted. The Track form is still legacy (below).
- Native readiness: `DOM`. Its presentation (`ListsForm.jsx`, `ModalHost.jsx`, 196 lines) is React DOM with CSS classes and has 25 browser-API references; a rewrite to `react-native` primitives is owed before native.
- Island disposal: the Track popup's React dialog is portaled to `document.body`, and React removes the host without htmx, so the island mounter never disposed it. Pressing Escape while the form was still loading stranded the dialog and blocked later clicks. `ModalHost.web.jsx` now asks the mounter to dispose the islands inside a host when it unmounts (`htmx:beforeCleanupElement`, after the commit). Browser verification (Chromium via Playwright, Linux): `IntegrationTest.test_escape_while_track_form_loads_leaves_no_dialog` sweeps Escape timings against delayed form and bundle loads; it fails without the change (stranded dialog) and passes with it; `test_glass_and_custom_grid_modals_fill_viewport` passes. iOS verification: not performed. Android verification: not performed. Status and consumers unchanged.
- Track form (`Deferred (blocker)`): not migrated. Blocker (evidence): the Track popup is not one form. `fill_track.html` is a seven-tab shell (General, Tags, Metadata, Collection, Episode plays, Status history, Discover) built from Django model forms that differ by media type, with three more variants (`fill_track_song.html` 13 KB, `fill_track_episode.html`, `fill_track_episode_bulk.html`), roughly 83 KB of included Alpine templates (date-time picker 11 KB, metadata panel 34 KB, collection fields, notes editor), a 1,461-line builder (`track_modal_views.py`) and 2,399 lines of tests. Its save views answer with htmx out-of-band fragments (status pill, score chip, progress card, notes) and `HX-Trigger` events, so a React form must keep posting through htmx. About 34 templates still own a `trackOpen` popup.
- Reopening condition and plan: port in this order, each its own change with browser proof: (1) a generic Django-form-to-JSON model for the General tab fields plus React date-time picker and notes editor, submitting with `htmx.ajax` so the existing responses keep working; (2) song and episode variants; (3) Tags, Collection, Episode plays, Status history, Discover tab bodies; (4) replace the `trackOpen` popups. Reopen when someone can take step 1.
- Remaining consumers and retirement: `fill_lists.html` is still returned for non-JSON requests; it retires with the existing `ListsModalViewTests` HTML assertions once the Track form leaves htmx popups, or sooner if no caller needs it. `list_item_button.html` is the same.
- Browser verification (Chromium, built-in browser pane, macOS, throwaway database and test login): opened from a Movies grid card (desktop, dark) and a movie detail page (phone width, light); added a list (spinner, then "On 1 list" and Remove), filtered by tag, forced a network failure (inline error, list unchanged), Escape closed it. Not checked: history/episode/table-row entry points, other theme states beyond dark and light, a screen reader. iOS and Android: not verified.
- Validation targets: `lists.tests.test_views.ListsModalViewTests`, `ListItemToggleTests`, `app.tests.test_media_card_contract`.

### RATING — Score display and picker

- Purpose/usage: cards, details, children and music scores.
- Status: `Partial / coexisting`. The star-row picker is React-owned on every consumer; chips, card rate buttons, popup wrappers and derived-TV fragments remain legacy Alpine/HTMX. Browser verification: see below. Native iOS and Android: not verified.
- Native readiness: `Primitives`. `RatingStars.jsx` uses `react-native` primitives with no browser API; browser behavior is in `mountRatingStars.jsx`. Not run on iOS or Android; its data still arrives as server-rendered props, not from the API.
- Implementation: shared RNW `frontend/ui/RatingStars.jsx` with the `mountRatingStars.jsx` web adapter, the `rating_stars` tag (`users/templatetags/ui_tags.py`) and `rating_picker.html` (Alpine wrapper). Legacy: `media_card_rating.html`, `media_card_rate_button.html`, OOB/score-chip/derived-TV fragments.
- Picker consumers: detail score chip (podcast shows, movies, TV, etc.), media card rate button, episode/track/row rating buttons, music artist/album pages, comic issue page. The adapter publishes writes through `htmx.ajax` so server OOB chip/card swaps still apply, and signals the Alpine wrapper with `rating-select`. Alpine publishes the current score through the wrapper's `data-rating`.
- Podcasts rate per show: chip and list cards post to `update_podcast_show_score` (tracker id), not `update_media_score` (episode plays) (#1830).
- Card consumer: the media card's rating button and its popup are React-owned (`CardRating`, using the shared `RatingStars`); detail chips, episode and track rows and music pages keep the Alpine popup wrapper.
- Retirement: the Alpine popup wrappers and direct-rating stars in `detail_score_chip.html` retire when the chip and card rate button are ported with a portal/focus proof.
- Contract: viewer scale, empty/read-only states, hover preview, toggle-to-clear, CSRF writes, teleported popup and OOB/events; derived score/coverage differs from direct score.
- Data: `src/app/score_views.py` and server score projections.
- Reuse/blockers: read-only presentation recommended first proof; interactive picker needs later portal/focus/write proof. Do not infer keyboard support from pointer behavior.
- Validation targets: `src/app/tests/views/test_score_views.py`, `src/app/tests/test_podcast_show_rating.py`, `src/app/tests/test_derived_tv_ratings.py`, card contract tests.

### LIBRARY — Result composition and media grouping
- Native library spacing passes optional `PageHeading` title/count styles through `LibraryPageView`: 30/36 title typography, 8-point mobile count padding and 24-point content top padding. Other page consumers keep the shared defaults. Status: `Partial / coexisting`; native readiness: `Primitives`; final browser comparison pending, iOS and Android runtime not verified.
- Current shared components: `LibraryPageView`, `FilterBar`, `MediaTable` and `MediaCard` are consumed by native `LibraryScreen` through feature adapters; status `Partial / coexisting`, native readiness `Primitives`. Games collection/franchise summaries use the shared server card model, page groups before ungrouped games, preserve the web group branch's ascending title ties, and drill into the same filtered query. Individual-entry mode keeps tracker identity separate from item identity for pagination, table/card keys and bulk selection. The phone library grid uses a 12-point gap. Web media-list/group templates remain consumers until their page composition, filter state and pagination are React-owned with equivalent permissions and interactions. Browser: final Collection/Series overview and drilldown at 375x812 confirmed cover, order, phone grid/header and return controls; grouping restored to Item and temporary fixtures removed. Separate-entry preference write reflected on the web was exercised; duplicate-entry rendering and remaining grouping/layout branches are not fully verified. iOS: Not verified. Android: Not verified.
- Native presentation: the native screen loads real data through its transport; all demo fixtures removed; loading/empty/error and signed-out states verified in the Expo web build. iOS/Android not run. Details: docs/ui/expo-parity-audit.md.

- Purpose/usage: media library grid/table and game/artist/album groups.
- Status: `Partial / coexisting`. Browser result composition, grouping, pagination and table remain server templates. The Expo Library screen owns native query, paging, selection and layout state and renders shared `MediaCard`, `MediaTable`, `FilterBar` and bulk actions through `LibraryGrid`/`LibraryBulkActions`.
- Implementation: `src/templates/app/media_list.html`, `src/templates/app/components/media_grid_items.html`, grouped-game fragments.
- Contract: bounded pagination, sort/group/view selection, statusless rows, public sharing and refresh with distinct item/tracking identity.
- Data: `src/app/media_list_views.py`, `media_list_entry_grouping_views.py`, `src/app/library_query/`.
- Reuse/blockers: native transport uses existing media-list, music and comic issue routes; scoped API operations cover saved views, bulk list/collection writes and Add Plays. Browser templates remain their own composition and fallback.
- Native readiness: `Primitives`. Native composition/adapters are in `native-proof/app/screens/LibraryScreen.jsx`, `native-proof/app/surfaces/LibraryGrid.jsx`, `native-proof/app/surfaces/LibraryBulkActions.jsx` and `native-proof/app/data/libraryTransportCore.js`. iOS/Android Expo exports compile, but runtime checks are blocked: `xcrun simctl` cannot connect to CoreSimulatorService and `adb` cannot start its daemon (`operation not permitted`). No browser tab was available for phone/wide comparison.
- Remaining consumers and retirement: Django library routes/templates remain the browser surface. Retire only after a separate browser migration preserves public sharing, alphabet, configured columns, grouped-game queries and pagination.
- Validation targets: `src/app/tests/views/test_media_list_entry_grouping.py`, `src/api/tests/test_media_list_page_cost.py`; [query contract](../architecture/library-query.md).
- Native presentation: native `LibraryScreen.jsx` composes the shared `LibraryPageView`, `FilterBar`, `BulkToolbar`/`BulkActionDialog` (through `LibraryBulkActions`), `MediaTable`/`MediaColumnMenu` (through `TableSlot`) and the media card with server sort, filters and paging. The filter sections (Rating, Collection, Progress, Genre, Implied Genre, Date, Released, Source, Availability, Language, Country, Platform, Format, Author or Channel, Streaming Service) come from `/api/v1/media/{type}/filter-options/`; layout, sort, direction, status and table columns are read from and stored to `/api/v1/library/preferences/{type}/`; Select all loads every matching row; Share View creates the public list through `/api/v1/library/share-view/`; the A to Z rail (`AlphabetBar.native`) shows from 768px; Music lists Artists, Albums and Tracks and Podcasts lists Shows and Episodes; a `tag` route param (from `TagsScreen`) opens the library narrowed to that tag. Tracked items render through `MediaCardSlot`, so a card's tracking, lists, history and rating are handled in place; artists, albums and shows keep the plain `MediaCard`. Web library stays Legacy; no web consumer changed. Native readiness: `Primitives`. Verification: Browser: compared with the web page through the Expo web build's native-variant preview at 375px (filters, saved status and layout, Select all, Share View, card tracking dialog, subviews, tag param) and at 900px (A to Z rail). iOS: Not verified. Android: Not verified. Still different from the web: the toolbar is the owner's `FilterBar` default variant with search and Save view fields rather than the web's gear menu; Group By for games is the owner's three buttons; "Show matching entries separately" is not offered.
- Native presentation: `FilterBar` toolbar variant draws the web's bare text dropdowns (label and small triangle, sort shows its label only); `BulkActionBar.native.jsx` is stacked like the web toolbar (count and links over a row of `Icon` buttons); `ColumnMenu` gains `compact` (sliders icon button). Consumer of the toolbar variant and the native bar: `ListDetailScreen`. iOS and Android not verified.
- Native presentation: `frontend/ui/DetailEpisode.jsx` (`DetailEpisodeHeader`: season and episode line, episode picker with previous and next; `showStill` hides the still where a hero already shows it) is mounted on episode pages by native `surfaces/DetailFeatures.jsx`. Status: partially React-owned (native episode page only; the web episode page stays a server template until its mount exists). `DetailView` cast, crew, seasons and recommendations use Home's `Rail` and `MediaCard` sizing in Expo, including the mobile grid preference; person cards retain person navigation. Web detail uses Home's rail and media cards for these sections, with server fallback. The Duo PWA and Expo Go rendered the changed rows; Android runtime is unverified. Web episode ownership remains until its mount exists. Still different from the web episode page: no cast, crew or genres (the page payload carries none) and no provider score.
- Detail season cards use the Home status, next-episode and progress rules and display their release year; recommendation cards omit the alternative-title control. The native detail API supplies the Home indicators without exposing tracking on public views. Web season and recommendation rails retain their server-rendered fallback. The iOS PWA and Expo use the same `MediaCard` presentation through platform adapters; Android runtime remains unverified.
- The shared `Rail` reduces its bottom padding by 4px across Home, Search, Media Details and other rail consumers. Adjacent detail rails use Home's 12px section gap on web and Expo. Web detail subtitles use the native card's muted, regular-weight treatment. Episode cast and crew mount the shared people rail with a server fallback; the rest of the episode page remains partially owned until its template migrates. Browser and iOS runtime checks are limited to the Duo detail comparison; Android rendering is unverified.
- Expo detail omits an empty Notes slot, preventing an extra gap between Collection and Seasons. Notes with content remain available in their configured position; the web already omits its empty visible block. Android runtime is unverified.
- Native presentation: `DetailView` takes optional `actionsSlot`, `scoreSlot`, `sectionsSlot`, `childrenSlot` and `onOpenPerson` props (web mounts the `header` and `synopsis` parts and is unchanged), and `DetailMobileHero` takes `actions`. Native `DetailScreen` loads the page payload (`surfaces/DetailSlot.jsx`, `/api/v1/media/{type}/{source}/{id}/detail/`) and fills those slots from `surfaces/DetailFeatures.jsx`: the track action bar with check-in, tags, notes, lists, activity history, the More menu (sync metadata, change cover, Hardcover edition, Seerr request), provider score chips with series graphs, the progress card and breakdown, the Collection block with add copy, the notes block, season poster cards, comic issue cards and anime episode cards. Native `surfaces/shellContext.js` publishes the open page's media type so the header search follows the web's "Search <type>..." behavior, and native `data/userDate.js` formats dates in the server time zone and the user's format. Status: Partial / coexisting; consumer: native `DetailScreen`; the web detail pages stay server-rendered. Native readiness: `Primitives`. Verification: Browser: compared with the web page at 375px through the Expo web build's native-variant preview on a film, a show, a season, an episode, an anime, a comic and a book. iOS: Not verified. Android: Not verified. Still different from the web: the hero and header facts are the page payload's own, links render as a section instead of a menu, the rating is a star row below the synopsis, a Details card is not drawn, and season pages show no provider score.
- Native presentation: `DetailPage.jsx` holds `DetailActionBar`, `DetailScoreRow` with `DetailSeriesGraph` (the "View series graph" grid, opened from chips that carry a graph; score chips with vote counts for TMDB, IMDb, Trakt, MyAnimeList and OpenCritic), `DetailBlock`, `DetailCollectionBlock`, `DetailNotesBlock`, `DetailRelatedGrid`, `DetailIssueCards` and `DetailEpisodeCards`; `FilterBar` sections accept an optional `idleLabel`. Native `surfaces/DetailFeatures.jsx` adds the web Activity History dialog grouped by day with remove, Change cover (shared `ArtworkPicker`, `expo-image-picker` behind `data/imagePicker.js` with `imagePicker.web.js`) and Hardcover Edition (shared `EditionPicker`) from the More menu. Status: coexisting; browser verification only; no iOS or Android run. Not seen with data: series graph, Hardcover editions, Seerr request, game lengths (the seeded account has none).
- Native presentation: `DetailPage.jsx` score cards (`ScoreChip` with provider logo, `compact` pill on the episode page), `DetailRelatedGrid` (season posters on a show page), `DetailIssueCards` (comic Issues, card and list layout) and `EpisodeCard` (banner, date and runtime line, track and rating) are consumed by native `surfaces/DetailFeatures.jsx`, which `native-proof/app/screens/DetailScreen.jsx` places in `DetailView`. Status unchanged (`Partial / coexisting`: web pages keep the server templates). Verification: browser (Expo web at 375px against Django web); iOS and Android not run.

### ALPHABET — Starting-character filter

- Status: `Web Migrated` across the surfaces below. Native iOS and Android are not verified.
- Native readiness: `Primitives`. `AlphabetBar.jsx` uses `react-native` primitives with no browser API; browser behavior is in `mountAlphabet.jsx`. Not run on iOS or Android; its data still arrives as server-rendered props, not from the API.
- Purpose/usage: desktop media library grid/table (including grouped games, artists,
  albums and podcast shows), manual lists (grid/table/tiers), and smart lists (grid/table).
- Implementation: shared RNW Pressable/Text navigation in `frontend/ui/AlphabetBar.jsx`,
  `mountAlphabet.jsx` web adapter, alphabet template tags and server fallback. The
  filtered empty state reuses the shared Chip for its clear action.
- State by surface: alphabet rail and filtered empty state are fully React-owned on
  every listed surface; Django fallbacks work before mounting or if import fails.
  Mobile has no rail. Surrounding library/list pages, result cards, tables and
  existing filter toolbars remain legacy siblings, not partially owned descendants.
- Contract: All/#/A–Z/representative other glyph; literal displayed-title initial, URL view state,
  filtering/count/group/pagination before hydration, independent cache variants.
  A 32px rail uses muted unboxed letters with an accent for the selection. Its
  links divide the available height so the full alphabet fits without scrolling;
  its top follows the first poster (or the result region when there is no artwork),
  with a safe header offset when scrolling. Numbers appear before A. The final
  glyph comes from an authorized title, using the viewer's title preference; no
  other-glyph entry appears when that bucket is empty unless it is selected. Missing titles use an
  ellipsis. The web adapter optically centers glyph ink with font bounds so
  full-width punctuation does not look offset. Mobile has no rail. Smart-list
  membership rules and permissions are unchanged.
- Coexistence/retirement: fallback HTML is intentional progressive enhancement;
  migrate the remaining result/filter components when they are edited, preserving
  their contracts. No compatibility deferral applies to the alphabet component.
- Verification: `scripts/test.sh app.tests.test_alphabet_filter_browser --tag slow
  --parallel 1` passes in Chromium 151.0.7922.34. Desktop grid/table, anonymous public
  lists, six basic theme/host combinations, fallback/mounted screenshots, keyboard,
  Back navigation, live form state and HTMX association/remount pass at 1440×1000;
  poster alignment and complete-rail fitting are checked at 1024×600/480/360, and mobile exclusion/no horizontal
  overflow passes at 390×844. Result bounds differ by less than one pixel on mount.
  Targeted library/list/provider tests pass; actual native iOS/Android and a live
  PostgreSQL execution have not been performed. Browser iteration builds the test
  schema from models; the normal fast suite separately exercises migrations.
  Stale-head asset coverage reproduces the unstyled horizontal fallback from an
  already-open pre-build page and verifies recovery on boosted sidebar navigation.
  Glyph centering additionally checks visible screenshot ink against the link's
  center, rather than checking only the Unicode text box.
  The representative glyph adds one narrow title lookup to full SQL list pages;
  the page's existing query scope is reused, including provider deduplication.
  Query-budget pins explicitly account for that fixed lookup and pass.
- Related work: none recorded. Deferrals: none for the browser component.
- Components: `AlphabetBar`, `AlphabetEmpty`.

### FILTERS — Filter state, menus and saved views

- The existing browser `savedViews.js` adapter registers sidebar and saved-view controllers before Alpine starts, or immediately when loaded after startup. Shared Sidebar presentation remains React-owned and the server fallback remains coexisting; library filter templates retain their existing ownership and retirement conditions. Browser evidence covers late fallback initialization and Explore toggling; saved-view reorder and actual iOS/Android runtime were not reverified by this bootstrap change.

- `FilterBar` sections may set `countAsFilter: false` for view grouping without treating it as a clearing filter. Status: `Partial / coexisting`; native readiness: `Primitives`. Legacy server filter/settings menus retire only after their page adapters own equivalent controls. iOS: Not verified. Android: Not verified.

- Purpose/usage: library/lists, History, Calendar and Home configuration where included.
- Status: `Partial / coexisting`. Library filters and saved views are native React Native controls in Expo; browser library/list filters and toolbars remain Alpine templates. The adjacent alphabet rail is React (ALPHABET) and Discover's media-type chips use shared `FilterChips` (FORM-CONTROLS).
- Implementation: `src/templates/app/components/filter_menu.html`, `filter_form.html`, toolbar/range/scripts, `sidebar_saved_views.html`; `src/static/js/libraryFilterState.js`, `savedViews.js`.
- Contract: normalized rules, clear/default/range/relative/multi-value handling, URL/history/sort, saved-view expand/reorder; refresh after Alpine flush avoids one-click lag.
- Data: owning view catalogs, shared library query, `src/lists/smart_rules.py`, saved-view endpoints in `src/users/views.py`.
- Reuse/blockers: strong state reuse; preserve per-surface availability. URL/forms/SortableJS remain web boundaries.
- Native readiness: `Primitives`. Expo uses shared `FilterBar` and server-backed saved-view operations. Browser interaction and actual iOS/Android runtime checks were not performed; exports are compile checks only.
- Remaining consumers and retirement: web library/list filter templates and sidebar saved views remain active; retire only when URL, form, range, reorder and refresh contracts have browser parity.
- Validation targets: `src/app/tests/test_media_list_filter_parser.py`, `src/lists/tests/test_list_detail_filters.py`, `test_smart_list_semantics.py`.
- Native presentation: `FilterBar` gains an optional `variant="toolbar"` (default unchanged). Status: shared presentation consumed by web `mountFilterBar`, `ListDetailScreen`, `CollectionBrowser` and native `LibraryScreen` (default variant). Retirement: the server filter menus retire once their pages mount `FilterBar`. Native readiness: `Primitives` (react-native primitives, props only; the device gate has not passed, so never `Ready`). Verification: Browser: not run (bundle compile and node/Django tests only). iOS: Not verified. Android: Not verified.

### TABLES — Configurable media tables and cells

- Shared `MediaTable` uses `entryId` with the item ID for distinct React keys in separate-entry libraries; selection and bulk transport continue using item IDs. Consumers include native `LibraryScreen`/`TableSlot`, list and collection tables. Status: `Partial / coexisting`; native readiness: `Primitives`. Legacy table consumers retire with their owning page migrations. Browser: separate-entry preference persistence was exercised; duplicate-entry table rendering is covered by API/transport regressions and requires a populated browser comparison. iOS: Not verified. Android: Not verified.

- Purpose/usage: library/list/collection tables and artist/album variants.
- Status: `Partial / coexisting`. Server table templates remain the browser implementation; Expo Library renders shared `MediaTable` against the same server results as its card grid.
- Implementation: `src/templates/app/components/table_items.html`, column menu/config scripts, `cells/`; list/collection row consumers in map.
- Contract: selected/order/persisted columns, sort, score/status/units, responsive scrolling/actions and bounded rows.
- Data: `src/app/columns.py`, result projections and column preference endpoints.
- Reuse/blockers: descriptors/formatting shared; accessible desktop tables and native list presentation may remain separate. Cells are child implementations, not independent units.
- Native readiness: `Primitives`. Native table rendering compiles through Expo exports; iOS runtime is unverified because CoreSimulatorService is unavailable and Android runtime is unverified because `adb` cannot start its daemon. Browser behavior remains unchanged and was not exercised.
- Remaining consumers and retirement: server table templates, column preferences, grouped variants and web cell adapters remain active. Retire only after native table covers configured columns and grouping semantics.
- Validation targets: `src/app/tests/test_columns.py`, `test_media_list_columns_browser.py` (slow/browser gates).

### BULK — Multi-item selection and actions

- Purpose/usage: the Select Items bar on media lists, custom lists and smart lists, the Update Status confirmation and Add Plays to History for TV and anime. Slow work runs as a job in a docked card, so the page stays usable. (Formerly two entries, `BULK` and `BULK_ACTIONS`.)
- Status: `Partial / coexisting`. React owns the toolbar (Library group: Update Status, Add to List, Add to Collection, Apply Tag; History group: Add Plays to History), the two dialogs and the job dock. Selection state, select mode and the card checkboxes are still legacy Alpine (`bulkSelection.js`, and `mountMediaCard.jsx` reading the same Alpine scope). Browser verification: toolbar, menus, dock review, background progress across navigation and partial failure exercised in the built-in browser. Native iOS and Android: not verified.
- Native readiness: `DOM`. Its presentation (`controls.jsx`, `mountBulkActions.jsx`, `mountBulkToolbar.jsx`, 711 lines) is React DOM with CSS classes and has 52 browser-API references; a rewrite to `react-native` primitives is owed before native.
- Implementation: `frontend/ui/mountBulkToolbar.jsx` (per list page, mounted from `src/templates/app/components/bulk_selection_toolbar.html`, reads `window.__bulkSelection`), `frontend/ui/mountBulkActions.jsx` (mounted once in `base.html` for signed-in users), the shared `ActionMenu` in `frontend/ui/controls` (styles in `controls.css`), `src/static/js/bulkSelection.js` and the list select button `src/templates/lists/components/bulk_select_button.html`. Alpine and React talk through window events: `bulk-selection-change`, `bulk-actions-open`, `bulk-actions-done`, `bulk-actions-clear`, `bulk-job-finished`. Add Plays jobs persist in localStorage (`floppy-bulk-jobs`) and resume after navigation or reload.
- Contract: identity/count/mode, eligibility, busy/error/reset/refresh and per-user permission checks. Add Plays to History shows on non-TV lists and reports those items as skipped.
- Data/transport: `src/app/bulk_action_views.py` (`bulk_status_update`, `bulk_show_plays_start`, `bulk_show_plays_status`, quick list/collection/tag endpoints), `src/app/services/bulk_show_plays.py`, `bulk_show_plays_task` on the default `celery` queue. Writes go through `apply_bulk_episode_plays`, the single-show Episode Plays path.
- Retirement: the Alpine select mode and card checkboxes retire when selection moves into a shared store that the cards and toolbar both read (see MEDIA-CARD).
- Reuse/blockers: no server fallback for the toolbar; if the island fails to mount, selection works but no actions show. Reopen if a no-JS path is required. Public views stay read-only.
- Validation targets: `src/app/tests/views/test_bulk_actions.py`, `src/lists/tests/test_bulk_actions.py`.

- Native presentation: `MediaCard` row layout accepts `model.rowSplit` and `model.rowWidth` (native search list only) to put title and actions on one line like the web list rows. Web unchanged. Verification: browser (Expo web) only; iOS and Android not verified.

### HISTORY — background refresh indicator

`HistoryFeed` shows a background refresh as a small spinner beside the month label instead of the "Refreshing history in background..." banner (web and Expo share it; the refresh-failed notice stays). Expo `HistoryScreen` keeps the last loaded pages per signed-in session and shows them at once on a revisit while the fresh copy loads. On web the month header is server-rendered, so the spinner lives in `history.html` (cleared by the cache poller's new `onStop` hook) and its month and year links use `hx-boost`, swapping the page in place instead of a full reload (Back still does a full load, as with other boosted pages). Browser and Expo logic only; iOS and Android runtime unverified.

### SEARCH — Global autocomplete, results and barcode input

Expo `SearchSlot` supplies the reviewed media-type menu, barcode scopes and copy to shared `GlobalSearch`; keyboard overlap, authenticated suggestions and scanner behavior remain in native adapters. `SearchScreen` adds no extra top inset to results. `SearchResultsSlot` uses the default shared shelf card presentation instead of nesting a Library grid host inside each result; token results, streaming provider rows, music routing and manual-entry navigation remain. Shared presentation remains React-owned with the existing coexisting web fallback and retirement conditions. Deliberate platform difference: the restored native shelf card opens Detail while the browser retains its existing in-place actions.

GlobalSearch reports a picked media type through `onTypeChange`; the web adapter and Expo `SearchSlot` both save it with `PUT /api/v1/search/type/` so the next page opens on it (browser and Expo logic only; iOS and Android runtime unverified). GlobalSearch and SearchResults retain the accepted menu/results geometry and theme accent. Browser keyboard overlap stays in keyboardOverlap.web.js; the native adapter supplies its own overlap hook and WindowedRail. Token results, manual-entry navigation and streaming provider rows remain. Existing ownership and fallback retirement conditions are unchanged; native runtime remains separately verified.

- ParentPicker adds an opt-in unframed native variant with a search icon for the Custom Entry page. The browser picker configuration sits inside its host's parent, satisfying the island loader's ownership check, and the web adapter imports the shared component explicitly to avoid resolving itself; the server fallback remains. The mounted web picker preserves the plain input, overlaid search results and original result element IDs. Browser: the TV manual-entry acceptance test covers parent search and selection; both web roots mounted and Deep Field was also selected in Expo. Native integer-field spinners and spacing differ; iOS and Android not verified. Native readiness: `Primitives`; retire the server fallback after complete parity and web adoption.
- Native presentation: `CollectionBrowser` now draws the web toolbar (search icon, Filters and sort sheets with drill-in rows, grid/table toggle) and renders the server `card` model per entry instead of its own card; consumer `CollectionView` / `CollectionScreen`. Native opts into the sort sheet's group-by-media-type toggle using the existing grouped rows, and field checkboxes and sort choices expose their checked state. The custom-field manager remains a separate native modal while web expands it inline. `ListCard`, `ListHeader` and `ListsPageView` gain the completion figure, the web's "·" separator, an ellipsis action, a type filter and full-width cards; consumers `ListsScreen` and `ListDetailScreen`. Status unchanged (shared presentation, Partial / coexisting). Browser: custom-field sort selected on web and Expo, grouped rows and accessibility recheck pending; no iOS or Android run.
- Native presentation: `CollectionBrowser` gains an `onOpenItem` prop and a card action (passed through `CollectionView`); collection cards use the API's `card` model and `media_type_colors`. Status: Partial / coexisting; consumers: `CollectionView`, native `CollectionScreen`; the web collection page keeps the server toolbar. Retirement unchanged. Native readiness: `Primitives`. Verification: Browser: Compared with the web page in a browser at 375px through the Expo web build's native-variant preview. iOS: Not verified. Android: Not verified.
- Search icon: shared `SearchIcon` in `Icon.jsx` supplies the same connected SVG magnifier to global search, its suggestions, CollectionBrowser and the provider directory fallback. Server-provided icons and remaining template consumers share `app/icons/magnifying-glass.svg`. Native and web keep their existing SVG rendering adapters; the control owners and retirement conditions are unchanged.

- Purpose/usage: header/page search and parent TV/season selection.
- Implementation: `src/templates/app/search.html`, search suggestion/parent fragments; `src/static/js/searchAutocomplete.js`, `searchShortcut.js`, `barcode-scanner.js`.
- Contract: type/local-All/provider queries, pagination/matched titles, two-character suggestions, active-descendant arrows/Enter, shortcut ignores editing, photo ISBN/error/manual fallback.
- Data: `src/app/search_views.py`, provider services, manual artist/album routes; API search parity unverified.
- Reuse/blockers: result/selection values shared; browser keyboard/file/blob and ZXing decoding need native camera equivalents.
- Status: `Partial / coexisting`. The header search form (input, media-type menu, barcode button and its error toast) is React-owned through `frontend/ui/GlobalSearch.jsx` and `mountGlobalSearch.jsx`, fed by the `global_search_react` tag in `app_tags.py`. It appears on every signed-in page. The suggestions list is still a server fragment that htmx swaps into `#search-suggestions`, and `searchAutocomplete.js` and `searchShortcut.js` still drive its keyboard handling through the same element ids. The Alpine form stays inside the host as the fallback. Search results pages are unchanged.
- Native readiness: `Primitives`. `GlobalSearch` uses shared React Native presentation, with `SearchSlot` supplying native transport and scanner behavior. The iOS shell places it across the content width and removes the blue outline on focus.
- This change: the iOS 27.2 Duo in Expo Go displayed the search type picker and an empty-result suggestion on the fully open screen. The search field was also observed beside the open sidebar. VoiceOver, barcode, Android runtime and browser interactions specific to this change were not tested.
- This change (result identity): `frontend/ui/SearchResults.jsx` passes the tapped result item to `onOpenResult(href, item)` so native consumers can open detail with a provider identity instead of an empty stub. Additive argument; web consumers ignore it. `native-proof/app/surfaces/SearchSlot.jsx` and `SearchResultsSlot.jsx` forward the same identity. Verified in the built-in browser on the Expo web build: typing shows suggestions and opening one loads detail from `/api/v1/media/.../metadata/` and `.../state/`. iOS and Android not tested.
- Verification: `app.tests.test_global_search_props`. Chromium (built-in browser, macOS) on `/discover`: form mounts with the right placeholder, typing shows suggestions, the type menu opens with 12 options, picking Books submits `/search?q=matrix&media_type=book`. The barcode scan flow (camera, decode, error toast) was ported but not exercised, and nothing was checked on a phone or in other themes. iOS and Android not tested.
- Barcode scope: the camera shows for All, Book, Manga, Comic and Comic Issue (`barcodeTypes` in `global_search_react` and `SearchSlot.jsx`; the server fallback renders it only for those scopes and keeps its spinner hidden). In All scope a typed or scanned checksum-valid ISBN also searches saved Barcode fields and each barcode-capable type in the user's search menu with its default provider (`_all_scope_barcode_groups` in `search_views.py`); results are grouped by type on the existing results page and a failing provider drops only its group. No new endpoint. Status stays `Partial / coexisting` (server fallback and HTMX suggestions remain). Verified: `app.tests.views.test_media_search` (All-scope fan-out). Browser, iOS and Android runtime not yet verified for this change.
- Update 2026-11-09: the suggestion rows and panel use the shared dropdown size (`frontend/ui/dropdownMetrics.js`: 12 by 10 padding, 8 radius), so rows are 60 pt and the panel shows about six; the blue focus ring on the web input is gone (the caret and open suggestions show focus; Expo never drew one); web suggestions read "Type · Year · Status" like Expo's, with "TV" rather than "TV Show" (`search_views._suggestion_subtitle`). Status is the stored tracker column, read in one query per tracker model for the few suggested items, so no seasons or episodes load; measured on a real library it adds one query per type and about 1 to 3 ms (TV typeahead is about 330 ms and All media about 760 ms either way, which this change does not touch). Items that are only collected or tagged show no status. Checked on web (rows and endpoint measured); Expo uses the same component and was not opened on the device. Ordering: web and Expo now read one typeahead, `get_saved_suggestions` (your saved library, collected and tagged items included, alphabetical by title, capped small). Expo used to read the tracked-only media list with its own default sort, so the same query gave a different set in a different order. Expo asks the web endpoint (`/search/suggestions?format=json`, now carrying each item's identity for navigation) on a session sign-in; a token sign-in has no session for that Django view and keeps the media list, so its order can still differ. Rows without an item (artists, podcast shows) open as a search on Expo. Relevance ranking (prefix before substring) was not added; it would change both platforms together. Layout: the full list scrolls (it is not capped) inside a window of as many rows as fit above the keyboard or the bottom of the visible area, between two and five, with the "Search online" / "See all" row pinned below it, on web and Expo from `useSuggestionRows` in `GlobalSearch.jsx`; arrow-key navigation scrolls the highlighted row into view. The room is measured, not guessed from window height, because the Expo pane is tall (669 pt) and the keyboard hides the lower part: native reads the keyboard height, the web reads the visual viewport. From the Duo screenshot with the keyboard up, the numbers work out to three rows; web measured 3 rows at 380 px tall and 5 at 560 px, footer on screen both times. The owner then validated the Search media type menu and the suggestions panel on the Duo (keyboard-aware resizing confirmed), and the window now takes every whole row that fits (four on the Duo with the keyboard up). Search menu and suggestions: web and Expo iOS at parity; Search results are a separate, unfinished surface.
- Update 2026-11-10: Search results are rebuilt as Home shelves on web and Expo (`SearchResults`, `searchRows.js`, `shelfWidth.web.js`, `useMobileGridLayout.js`): no heading, a library row then one row per configured provider with results, Home card sizing that follows the comfortable/compact preference, your library row arrives with the page and each provider's row streams in as that provider answers (providers also run in parallel), with a Searching online… line while any are pending. Suggestions close on outside tap/blur and stay closed after a search. Carve-out: Expo loads results with a password sign-in only, because the Django view reads sessions; token sign-ins show a prompt. Evidence: web verified in Chromium; Expo not yet seen on a device after this change.
- Shared logic for Search: `DROPDOWN` (shared dropdown metrics), `searchRowParams`, `searchRowUrl`, `mergeSearchRowPage`, `onlineRowParams` and `useStreamedRows` (row paging and streamed provider rows); `STATUS_ICON_SPECS` serves the card status chips. Platform values reach shared code through props: Expo supplies `useKeyboardOverlap` (`native-proof/app/data/useKeyboardOverlap.js`, the keyboard), the web supplies `keyboardOverlap.web.js` (the visual viewport) and `shelfWidth.web.js` (shelf card width); Expo's `WindowedRail` turns on `windowCards` for Home and Search rows, while the web mounts every card because its images load lazily (device carve-out recorded at the code).
- Validation targets: `src/app/tests/test_search_suggestions.py`, `src/app/tests/views/test_media_search.py`, barcode selfcheck.
- Web parity pass against v26.10.29: selected source and layout buttons use indigo-600 like the release page, the layout toggle draws the grid and list icons, and source pills are 14px regular.

### RAILS — Horizontal scrolling and load more

Rail retains optional per-item width and card windowing APIs. Native Home/Search use WindowedRail to mount nearby cards; web retains its established DOM/image lazy-loading behavior. This native-specific mount policy is documented beside WindowedRail and is not a visual redesign. Existing ownership, web consumers and retirement conditions remain.

- Purpose/usage: Home, cast, recommendations and related rows.
- Status: `Legacy`. Alpine and HTMX scrolling rows; the cards they hold are drawn by the shared React media card, the row container is not React.
- Implementation: `src/templates/app/components/_scrollable_row.html`, `_scrollable_row_js.html`, `src/static/js/horizontal-scroll.js`.
- Contract: heading/collapse state, arrows/drag/touch, suppress post-drag clicks, bounded load-more, stable art anchors and listener cleanup.
- Data: row descriptors/fragment URL/item template from owning view.
- Reuse/blockers: row/item values shared; scrolling/observer/pointer/persistence adapters required.
- Validation targets: `src/app/tests/test_horizontal_scroll.py`, `src/static/js/horizontal-scroll.selfcheck.mjs`.
- Web parity pass against v26.10.29: media cards inside a rails row mount again, so detail-page Recommendations show the year line, status chip, rating and hover actions instead of the bare first-paint shell.

### HOME — Shelves, deferred groups and cover refresh

The Expo Home adapter uses the default shared `HomeShelves` / `MediaCard` presentation, without an extra Library grid host, top inset, per-card progress row or floating settings button. Home row title navigation, bounded row loading, sorting, artwork refresh, signed-in transport and windowed native rails remain. Deliberate platform difference: the owner-approved native shelf opens Detail from card actions; the web adapter retains its existing in-place actions and quick progress controls. Page ownership stays partial/coexisting; server fallbacks and retirement conditions are unchanged.

Web Home retains its existing quick progress actions. Expo uses the reviewed shared shelf-card composition described above.

HomeView forwards optional card/progress renderers and row-title callbacks; the web supplies its progress renderer and Expo uses the default reviewed cards. HomeShelves retains the accepted common card widths and the three-request FIFO fetch gate (`createFetchGate` from `frontend/ui/fetchGate.js`) on web and Expo. Mixed/video rows do not adopt a separate widening policy. Django placeholder fallback suppression and single-flight row builds remain; native has no HTMX fallback. Existing ownership and retirement conditions remain. Final integration browser and native evidence is recorded separately.

- Purpose/usage: personalized Home composition.
- Status: `Partial / coexisting`. Page composition and server data remain Django templates and Alpine; the shared `HomeShelves` component owns shelf rows on browser and native surfaces, with the canonical shared React media cards inside each row. Phone cards use a 110 pt width so three cards fill the visible row; poster cards grow proportionally taller.
- Native readiness: `Primitives`. `HomeShelves` uses shared React Native presentation on web and Expo; Home data and actions remain in the browser and native adapters. The user reports extensive native Home use in Expo Go on an iPhone Duo; Android remains unverified.
- Implementation: `src/templates/app/home.html`, `frontend/ui/HomeShelves.jsx`, Home group/grid/deferred/artwork-poller components.
- Contract: configured sections, up-next semantics, deferred/coalesced cover polling, canonical cards/rails and progress actions.
- Data: Home row/artwork handlers in `src/app/views.py`, user configuration and server projections.
- Reuse/blockers: composition/data shareable; preserve per-user bounded queries; depends on cards/rails/preferences. Browser owns its Django/Alpine fallbacks; the native Home screen supplies the shared component from its adapter.
- Remaining consumers and retirement: Django/Alpine still owns page composition, settings navigation, deferred markup and the browser polling fallback; retire the coexisting Home surface only when those server-owned responsibilities are replaced with equivalent shared presentation and data adapters, preserving the server fallback and per-user query bounds.
- Verification: The user reports extensive use of the native Home page in Expo Go on an iPhone Duo and considers Home done for the current milestone; follow-up issues will be handled as individual bug reports. The OS and Expo Go versions and specific interaction coverage were not recorded, so this is user-reported iOS acceptance rather than a complete interaction checklist. Separately, Device Hub iOS 27.2 hot-reloaded the shared sizing change; three poster cards now fill the visible row and are slightly taller. Browser and Android runtime verification remain pending.
- Update 2026-11-09 (shared `HomeShelves.jsx`, `Rail.jsx`; native `authTransportCore.js`): one-line row header with the sort name collapsing to its arrow when it does not fit; the sort arrow flips at once with a dimmed row and spinner; failed rows retry three times before offering a tap; one early-artwork policy on web and Expo (a small budget of the covers a sort flip will show, sent by the server as `oppositeArtwork`). Device-specific carve-outs, each commented in code: native mounts only cards near the visible window (`WINDOWED_CARDS` in `Rail.jsx`; web already lazy-loads `<img>`), and Expo sends its cookies by hand with `credentials: 'omit'` because iOS joins repeated `Set-Cookie` values with a comma. Evidence: web runtime (Chromium pane, signed in to a real dev library, cold-load covers timed) and Expo iOS runtime (Device Hub, iOS 27.2, PWA beside Expo Go); Android unverified.
- Update 2026-11-10 (`home_deferred_groups.html`, `home.html`): server row placeholders no longer fetch on page load; the island loads every row, and the placeholders fire a one-time fallback only when `[data-home-root]` is still not `data-react-mounted` 2.5 s after load. A fresh load made 12 `/home/row/<id>/` plus 12 `/api/v1/home/row/<id>/` requests and now makes the 12 API requests alone (Chromium, `scripts/benchmark_browser.py`, 90 to 78 requests); with the island bundle blocked the rows still load through the placeholders. Carve-out: web only, because native clients have no HTMX placeholders and already use the island path. Browser verification only; no iOS or Android runtime verification.
- Update 2026-11-10 (shared `HomeShelves.jsx`, new `fetchGate.js` exporting `createFetchGate`): deferred row loads run through a gate of three, so a page of many rows no longer occupies every server thread. Same change on web and native (shared component, no carve-out). Verified by `node --test scripts/fetchGate.test.mjs`; browser load verified below; no iOS or Android runtime verification.
- Update 2026-11-13 (lazy Home rows; shared `HomeShelves.jsx`, `HomeView.jsx`, `fetchGate.js`, new `homeRowLoading.js` exporting `rowProximity`, `rowsToStart` and `rowPriority`): deferred rows request their data only when they come within one and a half screen heights of the visible area; rows on screen take the three request slots before nearby ones, and a queued row scrolled into view goes next (`createFetchGate` now takes an optional priority). A requested row is never cancelled or unloaded. If the platform never reports a position, every row loads after 3 s. Rows that were never requested start no artwork polling and no artwork prefetch. Without a `watchRow` prop (Search results) `HomeShelves` loads every row as before. Device-specific carve-out, commented in code: the browser reports row positions with IntersectionObserver (`homeRowWatcher.web.js`, using the nearest scrolling ancestor as its root; the 1.5-screen look-ahead is a pixel margin from the viewport height, rebuilt on resize, since a percentage margin resolves against width); Expo Home is a plain ScrollView with no intersection API, so `native-proof/app/data/homeRowWatcherCore.js` measures waiting rows with `measureInWindow` on scroll and content-size changes (`Screen` passes `onScroll`/`onContentSizeChange` through). Both feed the same shared decision. Waiting rows take the height loaded rows have (measured from loaded rows of the same media type and card width, remembered by the platform: browser storage on web, the app session on Expo; until then estimated from the rail header, card and the web progress control, `progressControlHeight` in `ProgressChangerTheme.web.jsx`), so rows arriving no longer push the page. Native measurements give up after 500 ms so one lost answer cannot stall later checks. Evidence: web Runtime (Chromium, built-in browser pane and Playwright, 1k benchmark fixture, cold order cache): a 1280x900 load requests 7 of 12 deferred rows (the first three request slots go to rows on screen), scrolling to the end requests the other 5, no duplicates, no row errors; a 390x844 load requests all 12 because the whole Home is 2.4 screens tall; island bundle blocked still loads every row through the server placeholders; Back restores the scroll position and requests the rows around it first; cumulative layout shift 0.02-0.03 before, 0 desktop and 0.0003 phone after. iOS Runtime (iPhone 16 Pro simulator, Expo Go): rows measured with real positions, 9 of 12 near at launch and the last two after the rows above settled; a mount race that dropped early reports (rows waited for the 3 s fallback) was found and fixed here. Android Runtime (API 35 emulator, Expo Go): 10 of 12 rows requested at launch; one run left the last two rows waiting after scrolling, the measurement timeout above is the fix, re-verification noted in the PR. Pre-existing and unchanged: Android dark theme draws rail titles and skeletons with the light palette.
- Validation targets: `src/app/tests/views/test_home.py`, `test_home_screen_season_status.py`.
- Web parity pass against v26.10.29: `HomeView` forwards supplied card and progress renderers to `HomeShelves`, retaining the existing quick actions on web and native. Video and mixed-media shelves retain the accepted common shelf width on both surfaces. Browser verified against v26.10.29; iOS and Android not verified.
- Home row title links (#1899): `HomeShelves` takes `onOpenRowTitle` and an optional `canOpenRowTitle`, and sets the rail's `onTitlePress` only for rows with a server `url` that the host can open. Web (`mountHome`) navigates to the url. Expo opens `Library` with the row's media type and filters (`homeRowDestinationCore.js`, `LibraryScreen` `params.query` through the shared `filtersFromQuery`); custom-list and mixed rows stay plain text on Expo because no native list-by-reference route exists yet. Evidence: web checked in a browser; Expo covered by `homeRowDestinationCore.test.mjs` only, device run pending; Android unverified.
- Native presentation: native Home card width follows the library grid (`gridLayout="library"` inside a `shelfCardWidth` slot) and `HomeProgress` follows the web changer rules on a phone (`+`/`-` only with quick season updates, unit hidden on the compact grid, from `/api/v1/user/preferences/` through `data/accountDisplay.js`). Status: React-owned shared presentation, no new component. Verification: browser (Expo web preview 375px) only; iOS and Android not verified.
- Native presentation: `HistoryFeed` and `HistoryFeed.native.jsx` draw icon month chevrons, a floating filter button with a count badge and the Filter History sheet, and day headers in the user's date format via native `data/accountDisplay.js` (preferences; handles flat and nested payloads) and `data/userDate.js`. Status: Partial / coexisting; consumers: `HistoryView`, native `HistoryScreen`, Home. Native readiness: `Primitives`. Verification: Browser: Compared with the web page in a browser at 375px through the Expo web build's native-variant preview. iOS: Not verified. Android: Not verified.

### PLAYBACK — Now Playing and check-in

- Purpose/usage: Home playback card and detail check-in state.
- Status: `Partial / coexisting`. `PlaybackCard` presents the shared list-item `MediaCard`; web mounts it through `PlaybackTheme.web.jsx`, and Expo uses the same component through `PlaybackSlot.jsx`. The web server fragment remains the fallback and owns refresh/action replacement; the native Home card uses a session-only JSON transport for all active cards and validated Pause/Stop or Stop/Cancel actions.
- Implementation: `frontend/ui/PlaybackCard.jsx`, `frontend/ui/MediaCard.jsx`, `frontend/ui/MediaCard.web.jsx`, `frontend/ui/PlaybackTheme.web.jsx`, `native-proof/app/surfaces/PlaybackSlot.jsx`, `native-proof/app/data/playbackTransport.js`, `src/api/fork_views_playback.py`, `src/templates/app/components/active_playback_card.html`, `detail_checkin_state.html`.
- Contract: 16:9 artwork spanning two regular media cards plus their gap on desktop, three on compact mobile, or two on comfortable mobile; show/movie title; one episode/progress subtitle; Pause/Stop for eligible manual check-ins and Stop/Cancel for session check-ins; current control identity, request replacement/order and stale-state handling.
- Data: playback fragment in `src/app/views.py`, `src/app/checkin_views.py`, server integration events/services.
- Reuse/blockers: presentation is shared and uses the canonical media-card visual model; permissions and current check-in resolution remain server-owned. Native detail check-in state is still a local demo. Browser verification remains pending. Device Hub on iPhone Duo (iOS 27.2) visually confirmed the Now Playing card fits the configured compact mobile span with its right edge visible; actions were not exercised. Android runtime verification remains pending.
- Native readiness: `Primitives`. `PlaybackCard.jsx` composes React Native MediaCard and action primitives; platform transport remains in adapters. The compact mobile layout had a visual iOS runtime check; comfortable mobile, desktop and Android remain unverified.
- Validation targets: `src/app/tests/test_playback_polling.py`, `test_checkin.py`, `test_checkin_session.py`, `test_live_playback.py`.
- Native presentation: `mediaCardSizing.js` adds `libraryGridLayout` (additive); consumers `MediaCardSlot` (new `gridLayout` prop, default keeps the old layout), `LibraryScreen`, and the older exports still serve `ListResults` and `PlaybackSlot`. Native readiness stays `Primitives`. Verification: Browser: not run (bundle compile and node/Django tests only; Expo web build with native-variant preview, FLOPPY_PREVIEW_NATIVE=1, pending coordinator visual pass). iOS: Not verified. Android: Not verified.

### DISCOVER — Recommendations and feedback

- Purpose/usage: Discover tabs/rows/hidden/preview and RSS row preview.
- Status: `Legacy`. Uses shared React pieces: media cards on every row and the shared `FilterChips` for the media-type row (`mountFilterChips.jsx`). Tabs, rows, hide/plan actions, previews and refresh banners are Alpine and HTMX.
- Implementation: `src/templates/app/discover.html`, Discover row/card/tab/preview components.
- Contract: enabled types, hide/unhide/planning, stale/empty/refresh states and bounded fragments; cards retain declared surfaces.
- Data: `src/app/discover_views.py`, `src/app/discover/` feedback/caches, separate REST recommendation contract.
- Reuse/blockers: candidate/feedback values shared; poller/HTML response replacement require adapters.
- Validation targets: `src/app/tests/discover/test_views.py`, `test_action_row_partial.py`, `src/api/tests/test_fork_discover.py`.

## Detail, tracking and ownership

### DETAIL — Detail composition and metadata

Media Details uses shared `DetailSecondary`, `DetailMetadata`, `DetailWatchProviders`,
`DetailStudios`, `DetailPromotedFacts` and `DetailMediumExtras` for Expo's saved
sidebar/content layout. `DetailView` reuses `Rail`, `PersonCard`, `MediaCard` and
`DetailRelated` for people, recommendations and related grids. `DetailScoreRow`
places the viewer rating beside provider scores; `ProgressCard` has an opt-in
detail presentation. Native metadata adapters preserve server formatting and
viewer rating preferences. `detailHeroLayout` and `detailArtworkCrop` anchor artwork geometry.
`DetailActivitySubtitle` renders the same activity dates and duration on desktop,
mobile web and Expo, with a white separator. Web retains its history button and
server fallback; Expo supplies formatted dates through its detail adapter. This
component is shared React-owned; the surrounding detail page remains partial.
The PWA mobile backdrop mounts shared `DetailBackdrop` via `mountDetailBackdrop`;
the server image remains its loading and no-JavaScript fallback. The surrounding
PWA hero and desktop carousel remain server-owned, so ownership is partial.
`detailSecondaryModel` and `detailSecondaryOrder` project ordered sections.
`DetailBackdrop` and its layout logic anchor sharp
artwork and clearlogos to the inner content strip. Intentional native carve-out:
artwork extends underneath the search bar and into the side rail; the PWA keeps
its search divider. Search overlay and overflow are enabled only for Details.
Expo fades the sharp image in from halfway through its search overlay while the blurred layer remains
behind search; the PWA starts its sharp image below the separate header.
On mobile, the clearlogo bottom and activity subtitle top sit on either side of
the sharp backdrop's fade endpoint with equal spacing; the web adapter measures that endpoint for its server
shell, while Expo lays out its shared hero directly. Desktop keeps its own hero.
The gap matches each platform's action-row spacing: 8px on web and 12 points in Expo.
Expo prepares backdrop and logo dimensions and coordinates initial tracking,
progress, scores and actions before revealing the detail header. It starts the
gallery and header requests from the navigation identity alongside detail, date
preferences and artwork preparation. The mobile web adapter waits for hero images before revealing the
server header and starts a cold gallery request immediately. Both have bounded
artwork waits; a late or failed image may still appear after the fallback.
Seerr availability comes from the private detail capability; its external state
loads on demand so an unavailable integration cannot hold the initial header.
Older servers retain asynchronous Seerr discovery.
`ProviderLogo` renders native SVG sources in its native adapter. Shared components
remain props-only; permissions, requests and dialogs stay in feature adapters.
PWA secondary templates remain server-owned; ownership is partial/coexisting.
Retire those consumers only after shared web mounting preserves all section
preferences, responsive states and interactions. Genre/link modal contents remain
deferred. Current backdrop revision evidence: web — runtime, mobile PWA on iPhone
Duo compared before and after; desktop comparison pending. iOS — runtime, Expo on
iPhone Duo compared before and after. Android — unverified; runtime comparison
pending. These checks do not establish complete page parity.

- Shared components `DetailPageView`, `DetailEpisodePageView`, `DetailChipCard`, `DetailListCard`, `DetailIssueCards` and `DetailEpisodeCards` (`frontend/pages/DetailView.jsx`, `frontend/ui/DetailPage.jsx`, `frontend/ui/DetailEpisode.jsx`) have no mounting screen: Expo `DetailScreen` renders `DetailView` from the structured detail endpoint. Status `Partial / coexisting`, native readiness `Primitives`. Browser, iOS and Android: not verified.

- Purpose/usage: general and medium-specific detail pages.
- Status: `Partial / coexisting`. Expo `DetailScreen` loads a structured, permission-aware projection and renders it through shared React Native presentation. The Expo path now includes the backdrop/clearlogo/photo/trailer hero (`DetailMobileHero`), linked provider score/tag chips, synopsis, detail links/facts, providers, book formats, game lengths, cast/crew, related/recommendation cards, season/episode/issue rows and editable TV episode ratings/watch actions. Music artist/album/track and podcast show details continue to use their structured API resources. The browser page remains the visual reference and server-owned implementation. Notes/history/collection controls, full activity subtitles, the provider Series Graph, provider-specific game extras and full tracking/action panels remain server-rendered.
- Native readiness: `Primitives`. Expo uses shared React Native detail presentation; iOS detail has a partial runtime comparison, while Android runtime remains unverified. Browser detail stays server-owned.
- Implementation: `src/templates/app/media_details.html`, detail title/mobile/synopsis/section/slot fragments in map.
- Native implementation: `native-proof/app/screens/DetailScreen.jsx`, `native-proof/app/surfaces/DetailSlot.jsx`, `frontend/pages/DetailView.jsx`, `frontend/ui/DetailComposition.jsx`; structured data: `GET /api/v1/media/{media_type}/{source}/{media_id}/detail/`.
- Contract: when the browser page has populated data and the viewer has permission, Expo presents equivalent meaningful data and permitted actions using native layout/controls. Preserve responsive art/title/meta, public/auth permissions, deferred gallery loading, episode pagination and rating/watch refresh. The provider Series Graph's color-coded season/episode score grid, notes/history/collection actions, activity subtitles and media-specific action panels are still web-only and must be migrated before parity or web retirement can be claimed.
- Data: `src/app/media_details_views.py`, `season_details_views.py`, detail builders and user layout configuration.
- Reuse/blockers: share typed sections while preserving medium composition and swaps; template contexts are not portable APIs. Retire the server detail layout only after all media-specific sections, interactions, responsive states, permissions and refresh boundaries are React-owned and browser verified.
- Verification: Device Hub iPhone Duo on iOS 27.2 loaded the current Expo bundle and a Breaking Bad show detail from the local server. Its mobile backdrop and logo were compared with the web season page on the production instance; crop, spacing, actions and sections still differ, and the two tracking states are different. A same-record browser comparison, season interaction and accessibility checks remain outstanding. Android runtime, interactions and accessibility are unverified. See `docs/ui/architecture-registry.json` for separate evidence.
- Validation targets: `src/app/tests/views/test_media_details.py`, `test_save_response_fragments.py`, `src/app/tests/views/test_trakt_series_graph.py`, `src/app/tests/test_detail_builders.py`.
- Book format links: a "Format" fact in the Details card of Book pages that joins the formats the viewer tracks, e.g. "Book, Audiobook", each name a link except the page being viewed. It replaces the provider's own Format fact when the viewer tracks another format of the same work; several audiobooks are told apart by narrator. Status: `Partial / coexisting`. Expo now displays `build_book_formats` values as a native section, but does not yet preserve cross-format links or the active-format behavior. The browser remains server-rendered. Data: `build_book_formats` (ISBN, or title plus author, among the viewer's own tracked books; never merges Items). Browser comparison and iOS/Android verification remain outstanding.
- Book narrator: a "Narrator" fact in the same Details card for Audiobookshelf audiobooks (`Item.narrators`, filled by the ABS importer, carried in the generic details payload). Status: legacy, same blocker and reopening condition as Book format links. Verification: browser only; no iOS/Android.
- Audiobook listening sessions: each Audiobookshelf listening session is a dated entry (date, time, duration, and where listening stopped) in the activity history modal and the History page, through the existing `session_history_row.html` row (one new "stopped at" fragment in that legacy template), so no new component. Status: legacy row, coexisting; the row has no shared React counterpart yet, and it moves when the history rows do. Data: `BookListeningSession` rows written by the Audiobookshelf importer, emitted by `history_cache_day_builder` and indexed by `history_cache_index`. Counted in Statistics as a separate "Listening Time" figure, never added to page totals. Verification: browser only; no iOS/Android.
- Book page history: a page-based (non-audiobook) book gets one dated entry per day its progress rose, built from its change log ("52 pages · at page 212 / 480"), in the same activity history modal and History page through the same `session_history_row.html` row (a new "at page" fragment in that legacy template). A book's first change-log row is a baseline and dates nothing, so a current page or percentage alone never produces history. Status: legacy row, coexisting. Blocker: the history row and the Statistics reading section are server-rendered Django templates with no shared React counterpart, and porting either is a whole-surface migration. Reopen when History rows or the Statistics reading cards get a shared React component. Data: `build_book_page_entries` over `HistoricalBook`, indexed by `history_cache_index`. Verification: browser only; no iOS/Android.
- Statistics "Listening Time": a stat card at the top of the Books Activity Overview (`reading_consumption_section.html`, `data-listening-time`) showing audiobook listening minutes for the range, kept apart from page counts (audiobook progress no longer feeds "pages", top items, completed-length chart or reading genres). Status: legacy, not migrated; same blocker and reopening condition as Book page history. Data: `BookListeningSession` minutes summed per day in `statistics_day_builder` (`totals.listening_minutes`), marked dirty by the session signal. Verification: browser only; no iOS/Android.
- Native presentation: `frontend/ui/DetailPage.jsx` (DetailActionBar, DetailScoreRow, DetailSeriesGraph, DetailBlock, DetailEmpty, DetailLoading, DetailNotesBlock, DetailCollectionBlock, DetailRelatedGrid, DetailIssueCards, DetailEpisodeCards). Status: React-owned shared presentation, coexisting with the Legacy web detail shell. Consumers: native `surfaces/DetailFeatures.jsx` only, placed in `DetailView` by `DetailScreen.jsx`; the web detail page does not mount it. Retirement: when the web detail page mounts these over server data, the server sections can retire. Eight native demo slots (DetailTrackingSlot, DetailChildrenSlot, DetailRelatedSlot, NotesSlot, ProgressSlot, ArtworkSlot, DateTimeSlot, RatingSlot) were deleted as unreferenced; `DetailRelated.jsx` is now used only by the web mount. Native readiness: `Primitives` (react-native primitives, props only; the device gate has not passed, so never `Ready`). Verification: Browser: not run (bundle compile and node/Django tests only; Expo web build with native-variant preview, FLOPPY_PREVIEW_NATIVE=1, pending coordinator visual pass). iOS: Not verified. Android: Not verified.
- Native presentation: `DetailPage.jsx` draws every action with `Icon` from the shared `actionIcons` specs (add, edit, tag, page, list-add, history, link, more) instead of text glyphs, and holds the web Collection card (collected counts, round add button wired to the shared `CollectionCopyDialog`), the horizontally scrolling progress and score row (`DetailScoreRow` with `progressSlot`, shared `ProgressCard` and `ProgressDialog` fed by `GET /api/v1/media/tv/{source}/{id}/progress-card/` and its season form), and the show page season cards (`DetailRelatedGrid`). `DetailComposition.jsx` `DetailSynopsis` renders no hidden measuring copy. Dates come from `native-proof/app/data/userDate.js` (server time zone and the user's date format). Status: partial/coexisting (web detail page stays server-owned). Browser (Expo web, phone width) verified for film, show, season, episode, anime, comic and book; iOS and Android not verified.

### CHILDREN — Seasons, episodes and issue rows

- Shared `DetailChildren` and native `DetailEpisodeCards`/`DetailIssueCards` own reusable presentation with RN primitives; status `Partial / coexisting`, native readiness `Primitives`. `DetailChildrenTheme.web` routes Track through the existing web `ModalHost` with a distinct target: a popup under the hidden fallback row cannot become visible by clicking its legacy button. The native adapter uses JSON-backed `TrackDialog` and preserves issue/episode identities. Server row/form fallbacks remain until their complete ownership and behavior migrate. Browser: issue Track opened the native dialog; the repaired web modal bridge and final write/undo remain unverified. iOS: Not verified. Android: Not verified.

- Purpose/usage: episode/season/comic detail and child lists.
- Status: `Partial / coexisting`. Season/episode/issue rows still use server templates and Alpine in the browser. Expo now renders the shared React Native `DetailChildren` with seasons, episodes/issues, pagination, TV watch/rating actions and related identity navigation. Spoiler obfuscation, full unwatch/drop/history/collection actions and browser scroll restoration remain server-owned.
- Native readiness: `Primitives`. Expo renders the child rows through shared React Native components; runtime behavior on iOS and Android remains unverified.
- Implementation: `src/templates/app/episode_details.html`, `comic_issue_details.html`, episode/issue/season/action/obfuscation/scroll fragments.
- Contract: ordering, watch/unwatch/drop, score/ownership/history, spoiler obfuscation and correct row/hero/scroll restoration.
- Data: detail/save/score handlers and source/media/season/episode coordinates.
- Reuse/blockers: shared row/actions; medium operations/order explicit. Depends on tracking/rating/collection parity.
- Validation targets: `src/app/tests/views/test_episode_history_poll.py`, `test_episode_score_invalidation.py`, `test_season_status_pill_sync.py`.

### TRACKING — Add/edit/repeat/bulk logging

TrackForm keeps the accepted tabbed dialog and field composition. Date shortcuts retain runtime pairing, and mountTrackForm submits the normalized payload and watches episode popup state. SelectField retains its original filter chevron with additive style props for other consumers. Existing ownership and retirement conditions remain; browser interaction coverage and native runtime are distinct checks.

- `ManualEntryView` is shared React Native presentation consumed by native `SearchScreen` in create-entry mode. Native shell `/create` navigation opens it; structured options, parent lookup and authenticated writes use the search transport and the existing web forms on the server. The browser manual-entry template and remaining Track popup consumers stay coexisting until complete parity and web adoption. Browser: Expo parent search selected Deep Field and created season 99; temporary entry removed and absence verified. Final layout comparison pending. iOS: Not verified. Android: Not verified.

- Purpose/usage: dialogs and manual creation.
- Status: `Partial / coexisting`. Native manual-entry presentation uses shared React; browser manual-entry and remaining Track popup consumers retain their server forms and out-of-band responses. Remaining popup blockers and retirement conditions are recorded under POPUP-HOST (Track form).
- Native readiness: `Primitives` for shared native manual-entry presentation; remaining browser popup consumers retain their existing migration conditions.
- Implementation: `src/templates/app/create_entry.html`, fill-track/music/podcast modals, metadata panel; `src/static/js/mediaStatusDateHandler.js`, `episodeBulkTrackForm.js`. Create Custom Entry now also offers an optional RSS Feed URL for custom podcasts; it is stored on `PodcastShow` and queues the existing RSS import. The React track-form island mirrors the legacy `[data-track-modal-root]` Alpine open state (`frontend/ui/mountTrackForm.jsx`), so its portal dialog stays hidden until the user opens the legacy popup instead of covering the page from first paint.
- Contract: medium fields/repeat identity, date/status/progress coupling, notes/errors/delete/events; bulk range/add modes/date distribution remain supported.
- Data: `src/app/track_modal_views.py`, `save_views.py`, Django forms and music/podcast handlers.
- Track dialog repair (#1878): the shared Track dialog now sends its built payload on save (it was posting an empty body), follows the Alpine open flag when an episode dialog is swapped into a card with no modal root above it so Close and Escape remove it, keeps the date shortcuts (Just Finished, Start Now, Release Date, copy-from) and the runtime back-fill that the server supplies, and exposes each status option's checked state with `aria-checked`. Data ownership and endpoints are unchanged.
- Backend normalization: season modals use the tracked item's coordinate; missing
  provider season lists disable the optional episode domain rather than failing
  the modal. Existing dialog presentation remains legacy and unchanged.
- Reuse/blockers: share fields, preserve distinct operations/server validation. HTML forms do not imply REST write parity.
- Validation targets: `src/app/tests/views/test_track_modal.py`, `test_episode_bulk_save.py`, `test_music_bulk_save.py`, `test_rewatch.py`.

### DATE-TIME — Field picker and activity calendar

- Purpose/usage: tracking dates and session history, distinct from release calendar.
- Status: `Legacy`. Alpine date-time picker and activity calendar; no React component.
- Implementation: `src/templates/app/components/date_time_picker.html`, `calendar.html`, `src/static/js/dateTimePicker.js`, `calendar.js`.
- Contract: clear/current/release/copy, optional time, 12/24h/week-start/locale, six-week grid/month/year, marked/selectable days, hidden values/events and Escape.
- Data: owning field/history configuration and user preferences.
- Reuse/blockers: calculations shareable; native field/popup, timezone and focus semantics need proof.
- Validation targets: owning tracking/history tests; comprehensive independent keyboard/timezone coverage unverified.

### NOTES — Markdown editing and display

- Purpose/usage: detail/media forms/music track notes.
- Status: `Legacy`. Plain JavaScript markdown editor; one include uses `Button`.
- Contract: Write/Preview, toolbar/selection, safe rendering, initialization after full/HTMX loads and save errors.
- Data: bound note fields and music note handler in `src/app/music_views.py`.
- Reuse/blockers: text/formatting intent shared; textarea selection and HTML preview need platform implementation/content safety review.
- Validation targets: `src/app/tests/views/test_music_track_notes.py`; general editor interactions unverified.

### PROGRESS — Adjustment and repeat breakdown

- Purpose/usage: Home/detail progress.
- Status: `Legacy`. Alpine and HTMX progress controls; no React component.
- Implementation: progress changer/breakdown/detail slot fragments.
- Contract: +/-/zero disabled state, spinner/live announcement, medium units/max, TV/season breakdown and run-specific cancel/refresh.
- Data: `src/app/progress_views.py`, progress handler in `src/app/views.py`, domain operations.
- Reuse/blockers: display/buttons shared; preserve authoritative server progress and operation identity.
- Validation targets: `src/app/tests/views/test_progress.py`, `test_rewatch.py`.

- Native presentation: `CollectionBrowser` table rows open the detail page when the host passes `onOpenItem` (the copy dialog stays behind the card action). Native `CollectionScreen` also sorts by custom fields (`field_<id>`) and opens the shared `CollectionFieldManager` from the copy dialog (PUT `/api/v1/collection/fields/`). Verification: browser (table row tap); the field manager was not exercised in a browser; iOS and Android not verified.

### OWNERSHIP — Collection browser and copy editor

- Native CollectionFieldManager receives the server's full media and field-type choices; custom-field sort and manager share CollectionScreen and existing web server controls. Browser manager/sort verification is pending. Legacy web consumers retire after shared adoption and parity. Native readiness: `Primitives`; iOS and Android not verified.
- Purpose/usage: collection page, detail/tracking ownership controls.
- Status: `Legacy`. Collection page and copy editor are server templates and Alpine; they use shared React media cards, `Button` and `Spinner`.
- Implementation: `src/templates/app/collection_list.html`, collection modal/form/summary/grid/row fragments.
- Contract: grid/row/table/filter/sort, completeness, multiple copies/labels, medium fields, season cascades and owner-only mutation.
- Data: `src/app/collection_views.py`, forms/models; canonical collection card surface.
- Reuse/blockers: copy editor/summaries shared; collection ownership differs from list membership. Depends on cards/filters/fields.
- Validation targets: `src/app/tests/views/test_collection.py`, `test_collection_copy_labels.py`, `src/app/tests/test_collection_season_cascade.py`.

### CUSTOM-FIELDS — Collection definitions and values

- CollectionFieldManager's native consumer now receives the complete server media-type and field-type choices. The web definition editor remains a server/Alpine consumer until shared adoption and parity. Browser manager interaction pending; iOS and Android not verified. Native readiness: `Primitives`.
- Purpose/usage: collection editor, summaries, filters/sort.
- Status: `Legacy`. Server fragments with plain JavaScript and SortableJS; no React component.
- Implementation: collection custom-fields/inputs fragments, `src/static/js/collectionCustomFields.js`, SortableJS.
- Contract: type/options/edit/delete/order, JSON saves, typed values/errors; do not duplicate importer resolution rules in UI.
- Data: collection definitions/values and endpoints in `src/app/collection_views.py`.
- Reuse/blockers: schema/field rendering shareable; native reorder and persisted ownership validation required.
- Validation targets: `src/app/tests/views/test_collection_custom_fields.py`, `src/app/tests/test_collection_custom_field_values.py`.

### ARTWORK — Cover and edition selection

- Purpose/usage: detail/tracking image replacement and book editions.
- Status: `Partial / coexisting`. `ArtworkPicker` and `EditionPicker` are shared React Native presentation in `frontend/ui/ArtworkPicker.jsx`. Browser `mountArtworkPicker` and `mountEditionPicker` adapt server props, files and requests; native `DetailFeatures` supplies its own actions and image-picker adapter. Django fragments remain the server fallback.
- Native readiness: `Primitives`. Shared presentation takes props and uses React Native primitives; file, camera, URL, browser and transport behavior stays in adapters.
- Implementation: `frontend/ui/ArtworkPicker.jsx`, `frontend/ui/ArtworkPicker.web.jsx`, `frontend/ui/mountArtworkPicker.jsx`, `frontend/ui/mountEditionPicker.jsx`, image picker/tiles/cover-change/edition/Hardcover result fragments.
- Contract: candidate/file/URL, preview/reset/save/return, accepted formats/provider identity, authorization and safe outbound fetch.
- Data: `src/app/cover_views.py`, edition routes; [local covers](../architecture/local-covers.md).
- Reuse/blockers and retirement: browser mounts and native Detail consume the same two pickers; retire the remaining Django fragments only after every picker entry point retains equivalent uploads, editions, provider identity and permissions with the required server fallback policy.
- Browser resolution: the web adapter explicitly imports the shared `.jsx` module. Extensionless self-resolution previously made both pickers recurse and raised `fallbackId` while Track opened. The esbuild dependency-graph regression covers both exports; post-rebuild browser interaction verification is recorded separately.
- Platform status: the import correction applies to web. Native already imports the shared `.jsx` module, so no equivalent resolver change is needed. iOS and Android picker interactions remain unverified.
- Validation targets: `src/app/tests/test_local_covers.py`, `src/app/tests/views/test_hardcover_edition_views.py`, `scripts/check_ui_architecture.test.mjs`.

### MUSIC — Artist/album/track and podcast composition

- Purpose/usage: artist relations/discography, album tracks, show/episode detail.
- Status: `Partial / coexisting`. The artist discography album grid and relation grid are React islands over Django fallbacks; album and track details, podcast pages and episode rows remain server-rendered/Alpine, with the manual-show episode manager tracked separately under `PODCAST-EPISODES`.
- Native readiness: `Primitives`. `MusicView`, `MusicAlbumCard` and `MusicRelationCard` use React Native primitives; native runtime verification remains unperformed.
- Implementation: `frontend/ui/MusicAlbumCard.jsx` maps the server album URL into the shared card model; `frontend/ui/mountMusicAlbums.jsx` owns browser navigation and the Django-rendered grid remains the no-JavaScript fallback. Artist relations use `MusicRelationCard.jsx` and `mountMusicRelations.jsx`. Album/track/podcast components remain in the source map. Podcast episode rows render an optional description and an empty state.
- Contract: hierarchy/deferred art, per-track actions/history/notes/scores, episode filter/pagination, repeats and show tracking.
- Data: `src/app/music_views.py`, `music_album_views.py`, `podcast_views.py`; web episode JSON/HTML is not proven native API parity.
- Reuse/blockers: remaining server consumers retire as their detail and episode components migrate; keep their current hierarchy/feed behavior and explicit playback boundaries. The album grid uses shared `MusicAlbumCard`/`MediaCard` and keeps its server fallback.
- Validation targets: `src/app/tests/views/test_music_release_views.py`, `test_podcast_show_detail.py`, `test_podcast_detail_rss_refresh.py`.
- Verification: Browser: local artist page island mounted and both album cover/title links opened their album pages after the href mapping fix. iOS and Android runtime verification not performed; registry status remains unverified.
- Native presentation: native `MusicParts` gains BrowseList, ReleasePickerModal and ManageEpisodesModal; the dead MusicTabs was removed. Native-shell presentation (not shared); consumers: `MusicScreen.jsx`. Native readiness stays `Primitives`. Verification: Browser: not run (bundle compile and node/Django tests only; Expo web build with native-variant preview, FLOPPY_PREVIEW_NATIVE=1, pending coordinator visual pass). iOS: Not verified. Android: Not verified.

- Page continuation: native `MusicScreen` consumes the existing shared music presentation without an empty header/Back row and supplies Music/Podcasts search context through its shell adapter. The hydrated WEB and native Aurora Static title both open the track detail, verified in the browser; inline notes/date formatting and wider detail layout remain Partial. Server template consumers and their retirement conditions remain unchanged. iOS and Android were not verified; readiness remains `Primitives`.

### PODCAST-EPISODES — Manual podcast episode management

- Purpose/usage: add, edit and delete episodes on a podcast show created through Create Custom Entry.
- Status: `Partial / coexisting`. React owns the manager trigger, dialog, episode list, form and inline delete confirmation through `PodcastEpisodeManager.jsx`; the episode rows, detail header and no-JavaScript management page remain server-rendered.
- Native readiness: `Primitives`. The dialog and form use React Native primitives, shared `Button`, `FormTextField`, `FormError`, `FormStatus` and `Dialog`; it is not mounted in the native shell.
- Implementation: `frontend/ui/PodcastEpisodeManager.jsx`, `frontend/ui/mountPodcastEpisodeManager.jsx`, `src/templates/app/podcast_episodes_manage.html`. The manager trigger is mounted from `src/templates/app/components/detail_secondary_content.html` and `src/templates/app/podcast_show_detail.html`.
- Contract: manual shows only (the viewer must track the show); create/edit submit the existing Django form and return field errors as JSON; delete asks for confirmation; duration accepts minutes, mm:ss or h:mm:ss; manual episodes reuse the normal PodcastEpisode catalog so episode tracking, playback progress, history and statistics keep working. Provider-backed shows keep their feed-owned catalog.
- Data: `src/app/podcast_views.py` (`podcast_episodes_manage`, `podcast_episode_add`, `podcast_episode_edit`, `podcast_episode_delete`), `src/app/forms.py` (`PodcastEpisodeForm`), `src/app/models/podcast.py` (`description`, `image`), migration `0223_podcastepisode_description_podcastepisode_image`. Create Custom Entry can also store an optional RSS feed and queue the existing RSS import.
- Reuse/blockers: remaining legacy consumers are the episode list rows, the standalone show page and the no-JavaScript fallback page. They move when the MUSIC episode-row family is ported; the manager no longer depends on them.
- Verification: Django tests (`app.tests.views.test_manual_podcast_episodes`, `test_entry`, `test_podcast_show_detail`, `test_podcast_rss_refresh`, `test_music_genres`), `npm run check:ui`, `npm run check:ui-architecture` and `python3 scripts/check_ui_docs.py` pass. Headless Chromium against a local manual show verified the trigger, add, edit, delete and the normal episode track modal. iOS and Android were not run.
- Related work: #1719.
- Deferrals: none.

### PEOPLE — People/studios, credits and medium extras

- PeopleView's native full-page consumer now renders the canonical shared media cards from person/studio credit data, with a native-only hero action size. Web hero/cast/extras islands and server filmography remain coexisting; retire server credit grids after shared web adoption. Browser: paired person screenshots exposed the old card drift; post-fix comparison pending. Native readiness: `Primitives`; iOS and Android not verified.
- Purpose/usage: person/studio pages and detail cast/trailers/game-length/reading sections.
- Status: `Legacy`. Person, studio and cast pages are server templates; credits draw shared React media cards and `Spinner`. Person and cast cards are separate hand-built components (see MEDIA-CARD exceptions).
- Implementation: `src/templates/app/person_detail.html`, `studio_detail.html`, cast/filmography/carousel/YouTube/extra fragments.
- Contract: internal/external links, role credits, bounded rails, carousel/lightbox/playback and medium metadata.
- Data: `src/app/people_views.py`, provider/detail projections.
- Reuse/blockers: presentation/data shared; embeds/playback/semantic navigation need platform decisions. Person cards intentionally differ from tracked media cards.
- Validation targets: `src/app/tests/views/test_person_detail.py`, `test_studio_detail.py`, `src/app/tests/test_detail_builders_game_credits.py`.
- Web parity pass against v26.10.29: cast and crew cards follow the user's person card settings (`cardLines`, `subtitleAlways`) instead of always hiding the role until hover. Studio and person hero title, fact labels and count chips use the release sizes (30px title, 12px label, 14px value and chips).
- Native presentation: new `frontend/ui/PeopleToolbar.jsx` (PeopleToolbar: filter and sort) and a `toolbar` slot on `PeopleView`. Status: React-owned shared presentation; web surface stays Legacy and does not pass `toolbar`. Consumers: native `PeopleScreen.jsx` only. Retirement: when the web person/studio page mounts `PeopleView` with the toolbar. Native readiness: `Primitives` (react-native primitives, props only; the device gate has not passed, so never `Ready`). Verification: Browser: not run (bundle compile and node/Django tests only). iOS: Not verified. Android: Not verified.
- Cast/crew rail (#1953): `{% people_cast %}` renders `PeopleView` (`part="cast"`, shared `MediaCard`) on media detail and episode pages; the server cards it shows before mount (`detail_cast_grid.html` → `person_card_inline.html`) now read the same `_people_cast_props` items, so person links are built once for React, the fallback and the API. The fallback previously rebuilt links from `media.source`, which the episode page lacks, and 500'd. Status: `Partial / coexisting` (React owns the rail after mount; the server cards remain the first-paint fallback). Retirement: when the rail no longer needs server cards before mount. Fallback width: cast and crew rows use `home-row-card w-44`, like Home and the other detail rails, so the pre-mount cards match `shelfCardWidth` (desktop 176×264 in both states; cast-rail CLS 0 on mount). Remaining difference: phone 106px fallback against 110px mounted, from the shared `--card-cap` phone rule that Home rails also use. Validation: `app.tests.views.test_media_details` (episode credits link test). Browser: Chromium, episode page with bundles blocked and mounted, both 200 with `/person/tmdb/...` links. iOS: Not verified. Android: Not verified; native episode credits come from the API, which passes `source` to `_people_cast_props` and needed no change.
- Native presentation: `PeopleToolbar` is now the web's two-label row (filter menu and sort with direction arrow) opening sheets; `PeopleView` shows the Watched Content section (with its empty copy) for people as the web does; `PeopleScreen` has no Back link. Status: React-owned shared presentation. Verification: browser only; iOS and Android not verified.

### TAGS — Management and assignment
- Native presentation: the native screen loads real data through its transport; all demo fixtures removed; loading/empty/error and signed-out states verified in the Expo web build. iOS/Android not run. Details: docs/ui/expo-parity-audit.md.

- Purpose/usage: tag index, detail/library/bulk tagging and settings tag filters.
- Status: `Legacy`. Server fragments with Alpine; no React component.
- Implementation: `src/templates/app/tag_index.html`, fill/tag-button/detail-preview fragments, `src/templates/users/components/media_tag_filter.html`.
- Contract: search/select/add/remove, item/bulk identity, confirmed library-wide delete and consistent filter semantics.
- Data: `src/app/tag_views.py`, user-owned tag relations/library query.
- Reuse/blockers: chip/selection model shared; destructive/ownership checks stay server-enforced.
- Validation targets: `src/app/tests/views/test_tags.py`, `src/users/tests/views/test_settings_media_tag_filters.py`.

### METADATA-REVIEW — Episode order, provider switch and remap

- Purpose/usage: explicit review/correction workflows.
- Status: `Legacy`. Server templates with a plain JavaScript review script; one include uses `Spinner`.
- Implementation: `src/templates/app/episode_ordering.html`, `tv_provider_switch.html`, remap/library-move results, `src/static/js/episodeOrderReview.js`.
- Contract: matched/suggested/manual/archived choices, source/episode coordinates, confirmations/errors and preserved user tracking.
- Data: `src/app/episode_order_views.py`, metadata-sync/detail routes and domain services.
- Reuse/blockers: selection/review patterns shared; mutation semantics need explicit API audit.
- Validation targets: `src/app/tests/test_episode_ordering.py`, `test_tv_provider_switch.py`.

### DETAIL-RELATED — Related-media sections and Steam DLC cards

- Purpose/usage: game/media detail related sections (IGDB DLCs, expansions, remakes) plus display-only Steam DLC cards when IGDB lists none.
- Implementation: legacy Django template `src/templates/app/components/detail_secondary_content.html`; heading via `related_section_label` in `src/app/templatetags/app_tags.py`; data from `app.providers.igdb.get_steam_dlcs`.
- Contract: Steam DLC cards are untracked links to the Steam store (title, header image, URL); IGDB DLCs remain tracked media cards.
- Status: `Partial / coexisting`. Browser IGDB related cards use the React media card (`{% media_card "related" %}`, surface `related`), while its section shell and Steam DLC cards remain server-rendered. Expo uses shared React Native `DetailRelated` cards for related/recommendation projections; Steam DLC cards and every provider-specific relationship are not yet represented in the projection.
- Native readiness: `Primitives`. Expo uses shared React Native related cards; iOS and Android runtime verification remain unperformed.
- Validation: `app.tests.providers.test_metadata` (`get_steam_dlcs`), `app.tests.test_templatetags`. Browser/iOS/Android verification: none.

## Feature interfaces

- Native presentation: `HistoryFeed.native.jsx` passes `filterVariant="select"` and `webActions` to the shared feed: the filter sheet uses `SelectField` dropdowns (Media type, View mode, Genre, Implied Genre) and card overlay actions are the web's Edit tracking, Add to custom lists, View your activity history (new `onAddToList`). Web (chips, Activity/Edit/Delete) unchanged. Native `HistoryScreen` also honours `params.filters` and opens music and podcast entries on the Music screen. Verification: browser (Expo web) only; iOS and Android not verified.

### HISTORY — Feed, edits and activity dialog
- Native presentation: the native screen loads real data through its transport; all demo fixtures removed; loading/empty/error and signed-out states verified in the Expo web build. iOS/Android not run. Details: docs/ui/expo-parity-audit.md.

- Purpose/usage: global history and per-item sessions/repeats.
- Status: `Legacy`. Day feed, filters, edit forms and the session dialog are server templates. They use shared React pieces: the media card in History layout (`history_card_react`) and `Button` (Load more).
- Implementation: `src/templates/app/history.html`, history day/card/edit and session modal/day/row fragments, `src/static/js/sessionHistory.js`.
- Contract: filters/modes/days, bounded fragments/refresh notice, edit/delete/units, marked dates/day jumps, close-button focus and nested refresh.
- Data: `src/app/history_views.py`, `src/events/history_feed.py`; [memory contract](../architecture/history-memory.md).
- Reuse/blockers: day/session values shared; date/filter dependencies. Never client-load whole history.
- Validation targets: `src/app/tests/views/test_history.py`, `src/app/tests/test_history_item_projection.py`, `test_history_day_cache_lifecycle.py`.
- Native presentation: `HistoryEntryRow` is replaced by `HistoryEntryCard` in `frontend/ui/HistoryFeed.jsx`; `HistoryView` takes a `Feed` prop and the native screen passes `HistoryFeed.native.jsx`. Consumers: `HistoryView` (native), `mountHistoryFeed.jsx` and `HistoryFeed.web.jsx` (dialogs only). Web day feed stays Legacy. Native readiness: `Primitives` (react-native primitives, props only; the device gate has not passed, so never `Ready`). Verification: Browser: not run (bundle compile and node/Django tests only; Expo web build with native-variant preview, FLOPPY_PREVIEW_NATIVE=1, pending coordinator visual pass). iOS: Not verified. Android: Not verified.
- Native presentation: `HistoryFeed` month bar uses `Icon` chevrons and hides the year jumps below 384px, the filter toolbar is replaced by an exported `HistoryFilterFab` plus a bottom-sheet `Filter History` dialog (controlled via `filtersOpen`/`onFiltersOpenChange`), card actions use icon specs, no title or subtitle on native (`HistoryView` `title={null}`), day header and summary sizes match the web. `Screen` gained a `floating` slot. Status: React-owned shared presentation. Verification: browser only; iOS and Android not verified.
- Native presentation: native `HistoryScreen` (consumer of `HistoryView`/`HistoryFeed.native.jsx`) now pages release-date mode by day (`limit`/`offset`, same pager as the activity feed) because `/api/v1/history/release/` is bounded per response. No shared component changed; status stays `Legacy` for the web page. Verification: transport unit test only. Browser: Not verified. iOS: Not verified. Android: Not verified.

- Native presentation: `StatisticsPreferencesButton`, `StatisticsPreferencesModal` (built on `SelectField`) and `StatisticsBanner` (Building/Refreshing notice), all in `StatisticsPreferences.jsx` saves through PATCH `/api/v1/statistics/preferences/`, now carrying activity view, duration format, week start, rating scale and the anime split. Consumer: native `StatisticsScreen` only; the web keeps its Alpine modal. Verification: browser (Expo web) only; iOS and Android not verified.

### STATISTICS — Dashboard, charts and taste/talent
- Native presentation: the native screen loads real data through its transport; all demo fixtures removed; loading/empty/error and signed-out states verified in the Expo web build. iOS/Android not run. Details: docs/ui/expo-parity-audit.md.

- Purpose/usage: statistics, comparison, activity/highlights and featured repeats.
- Status: `Legacy`. Server templates with Chart.js and plain JavaScript; no React component.
- Implementation: `src/templates/app/statistics.html`, statistics/taste/role/studio/featured fragments; `src/static/js/statistics-charts.js`, `stats-media-merge.js`, `date-range.js`, Chart.js/datalabels.
- Contract: media/range/comparison, dates/units, charts/heatmaps/order, refresh/errors and teardown; avoid drift in server/JS media visual mappings.
- Data: `src/app/statistics_views.py`, snapshots/[statistics sync](../architecture/statistics-sync.md).
- Reuse/blockers: transforms/tokens shared; canvas needs native renderer. Keep expensive computation server-owned.
- Validation targets: `src/app/tests/views/test_statistics.py`, `src/app/tests/test_statistics_sync.py`, `test_statistics_media_merge_js.py`; browser layout checks are slow.
- Web parity pass against v26.10.29: summary card text blocks cap at the card width so one-line labels truncate instead of spilling when the page font is wider (seen with a wide system font at 1024px). Browser verified; iOS and Android not verified.
- Native presentation: `StatisticsSections`, `StatisticsCharts` and `StatisticsSummary` accept optional palette keys (roleActors, roleActresses, roleDirectors, roleWriters, eraAccent, eraIcon, ratingStar, menuSurface, menuBorder, featuredMovies, featuredGames, featuredShows, activeDay, streak); the web mounts are unchanged. Some hex literals remain (pager dot, scrim) and the web preferences modal is not rebuilt natively. Web Statistics stays Legacy. Native readiness: `Primitives` (react-native primitives, props only; the device gate has not passed, so never `Ready`). Verification: Browser: not run (bundle compile and node/Django tests only). iOS: Not verified. Android: Not verified.
- Native presentation: `StatisticsToolbar` (in `StatisticsSummary`) is the web's stacked range and media-type rows with calendar and funnel icons plus the Compare-to row and a refresh icon button; `SortMenu` is exported (`bare` variant); the native screen drops the title, subtitle and separate Comparison card, and list keys in overview panels include the index (duplicate-key fix). `DiscoverScreen` toolbar and toast use `Icon` (refresh, x); `SelectField` draws an `Icon` chevron only with `iconChevron` (native `ListsScreen`; web keeps the glyph). Web regression check: HEAD vs working tree pixel-identical for these. Shared icons live in `frontend/ui/actionIcons.js` (added: refresh, calendar, funnel, chevronRight, chevronsLeft, chevronsRight, bookmarkPlus, eyeOff, fourSquare, list). Status: React-owned shared presentation. Verification: browser only; iOS and Android not verified.

### RELEASE-CALENDAR — Upcoming releases and subscriptions

- Shared CalendarLinks accepts a session-required state from CalendarScreen. Calendar subscription URLs contain the permanent account token and require password-session sign-in; bearer calendar browsing remains. Defaults preserve browser/session links. Existing ownership and fallback retirement conditions remain; transport checks cover denial handling, while browser appearance and actual iOS/Android runtime for this state are not verified.

- Native `CalendarSlot` passes the shared `ReleaseCalendar` `surfaceMutedSoft` token for blank days. Browser: compared the current empty November calendar at 375x812; blank-day fill matches the WEB, while subtitle wrapping still differs. Existing browser calendar ownership remains unchanged. iOS: Not verified. Android: Not verified. Native readiness: `Primitives`.

- Purpose/usage: release calendar page, not `DATE-TIME`.
- Status: `Partial / coexisting`. The gear menu (Go to Today, Fetch New Releases, Download Calendar, Week starts on Monday/Sunday) is React-owned through the shared `ActionMenu` (now with an icon trigger, link items and a pressed state on inline actions). The month grid, agenda, list, filters and toolbar remain legacy Alpine/server templates. Browser verification: menu, week-start switch and agenda labels exercised in the built-in browser. Native iOS and Android: not verified.
- Native readiness: `DOM`. Its presentation (`controls.jsx`, 377 lines) is React DOM with CSS classes and has 24 browser-API references; a rewrite to `react-native` primitives is owed before native.
- Implementation: `src/templates/events/calendar.html`, calendar grid/list components; mostly inline Alpine. Gear menu: `frontend/ui/mountCalendarLinks.jsx` + `ActionMenu` in `frontend/ui/controls`; props from `events.views._calendar_menu_props`. The week start saves through the existing `update_statistics_preferences` endpoint (same `week_start_day` the date pickers and Statistics read), then reloads.
- Episode labels: grid agenda and list share `Event.season_episode_label` ("S39E170"); a season's title drops a trailing "Season N" so the label carries it once.
- Contract: month/today/grid/list, media/status/release/tag filters, persisted view, grouped dates/media, ICS/download/subscription/reload and empty states. Redesign needs explicit requirements.
- Data: `src/events/views.py`, `src/events/calendar/`, tasks; [reload contract](../architecture/calendar-reload.md), REST parity unverified.
- Retirement: the Alpine toolbar/grid retire as the filter menu and day grid are ported. The server-rendered "Go to Today" link inside the menu host is the no-JS fallback.
- Reuse/blockers: date/filter/group values shared; layout/ICS/browser subscription adapters explicit.
- Validation targets: `src/events/tests/test_views.py`, `test_release_semantics.py`, `calendar/test_main.py`, `src/api/tests/test_calendar.py`.
- Native presentation: `CalendarView` gains `onRetry`; `ReleaseCalendar` gains `showRegionNotice` and `onOpenPreferences` (native only). Consumers: native `CalendarScreen.jsx` and the existing web mounts (unchanged). The month grid stays Legacy on the web. Native readiness for these props: `Primitives`. Verification: Browser: not run (bundle compile and node/Django tests only; Expo web build with native-variant preview, FLOPPY_PREVIEW_NATIVE=1, pending coordinator visual pass). iOS: Not verified. Android: Not verified.

- Native presentation: `ViewToggle` (new, props-only layout icon switch) and `FilterBar`'s new `trailing` slot give list detail the web's All / Status / sort / layout-icons toolbar; `ListHeader` gains `menu` and `trailing` (split Add New Item button with the web dropdown: Edit List, Members, activity, recommendations, Export as CSV) and `ListResults` cards drop the extra subtitle line. Native-only consumers (`ListDetailScreen`); web unchanged. Trakt (device flow), MDBList and CSV imports and CSV export run through `/api/v1/lists/import/*` and `/api/v1/lists/{id}/export/` (`ListImportDialog`, native screen component). Status: React-owned shared presentation. Verification: browser (Expo web, phone width) only; iOS and Android not verified.

### LISTS — Lists, memberships, public profiles and collaboration

- Native ListsPageView/ListCard hide hub metadata only when requested; ListResults uses a desktop-only editor selection trigger and shares its bulk bar with tier view. Native list pins persist per server and user and appear in Sidebar. The shared `MdblistConnect` uses server-provided schedule options and keeps the entered credential local; native ListImportDialog owns transport and link behavior. Web list, import and tier templates retain ownership and existing defaults; retire them after shared adoption and parity. Browser recheck of these fixes pending; iOS and Android not verified. Native readiness: `Primitives`.
- Purpose/usage: list browser/detail/activity/profile/forms and membership popup.
- Status: `Legacy`. Manual-list grid/table/tiers and public detail pages use the React alphabet rail (ALPHABET), media cards, `Spinner` and `Button`. List headers, toolbars, tables and editing controls retain legacy ownership; migrate each when edited.
- Implementation: `src/templates/lists/custom_lists.html`, `list_detail.html`, `user_profile.html`, `list_activity.html`, list grid/form/visibility/membership/table components.
- Contract: manual/smart/source-backed distinction, search/tags/roles, public/unlisted/private, membership/pins/feed/export/sync and public read-only rendering.
- Data: `src/lists/views.py`, browse/action/helper views, models/forms; REST parity separately assessed.
- Reuse/blockers: list card/editor/membership shared; consume canonical media/filter/table systems; collection ownership is separate.
- Validation targets: `src/lists/tests/test_views.py`, `test_forms.py`, `test_rss_feed.py`, `test_csv_export_import.py`.
- Native presentation: `ListFormView` gains a username adder, `ListMembership` an opt-in `allowUsernameEntry`, `ListResults` list and tag pickers in the bulk bar; `SmartRules` and `CollectionCustomFields` gain native consumers. Consumers: native `ListsScreen`, `ListDetailScreen`, `CollectionScreen` (and `DetailScreen` for `ListMembership`). The web list pages stay Legacy and mount none of these. Retirement: when the server list form and results mount the shared views. Native readiness: `Primitives` (react-native primitives, props only; the device gate has not passed, so never `Ready`). Verification: Browser: not run (bundle compile and node/Django tests only; Expo web build with native-variant preview, FLOPPY_PREVIEW_NATIVE=1, pending coordinator visual pass). iOS: Not verified. Android: Not verified.
- Native presentation: native `ListDetailScreen` draws a media type breakdown popover (local `MediaTypeBreakdown`, fed by `media_type_breakdown` on `GET /api/v1/lists/{id}/`) opened from the shared `actionIcons.pieChart`; the Lists hub gains a Last Watched sort and a New List menu. `ListFormView` is a shared form with a `urlPrefix` prop so the public URL preview has no invented host (consumer `ListsScreen`); it was not compared in a browser. Status: Partial / coexisting; native readiness `Primitives`; the web list pages stay Legacy. Verification: Browser: Compared with the web page in a browser at 375px through the Expo web build's native-variant preview. iOS: Not verified. Android: Not verified. ListFormView: Verification: Browser: not compared. iOS: Not verified. Android: Not verified.

### SMART-RULES — Rule editing and results

- Purpose/usage: smart-list detail/editor/summary.
- Status: `Legacy`. Smart-list grid/table detail pages use the React alphabet rail (ALPHABET) and `Spinner`; rule editing, summaries and result components remain legacy. Alphabet view state does not alter their saved rule or permission contracts.
- Implementation: `src/templates/lists/smart_list_detail.html`, smart rules builder/summary components.
- Contract: initial JSON/live editing/save/errors, results/sort/bulk and shared rule semantics.
- Data: `src/lists/views_smart_list.py`, `smart_rules.py`, library query engine.
- Reuse/blockers: normalized filter state/schema shared; never fork evaluation for native/Home.
- Validation targets: `src/lists/tests/test_smart_list_semantics.py`, `test_smart_list_sync_deferral.py`.

### LIST-CURATION — Search, add and recommend

- Purpose/usage: add/recommend/approval pages and preview dialogs.
- Status: `Legacy`. Add, recommend and approval pages are server templates; they use shared React media cards, `Spinner` and `Badge`.
- Implementation: `src/templates/lists/add_item.html`, `recommend_item.html`, `list_recommendations.html`, search/preview components.
- Contract: provider/type/query/pagination, preview/add/recommend/approve/deny and role-specific permissions.
- Data: `src/lists/views_add_reorder.py`, `views_recommendations.py` and distinct actions.
- Reuse/blockers: parallel search/preview presentation can consolidate; do not merge authorization/submission semantics. Depends on search/cards/dialogs.
- Validation targets: `src/lists/tests/test_views.py`, `test_item_rank.py`, `test_integration.py`.

### TIERS — Board, order and export

- ListDetailScreen now shows the shared ListBulkBar above TierBoard while selection is active, matching the web toolbar outside the tier layout; web tier tiles do not expose selection checkboxes. Server tier board remains until shared web adoption. Browser recheck pending; iOS and Android not verified. Native readiness: `Primitives`.
- Purpose/usage: editable/public list tier boards.
- Status: `Legacy`. Tier board, drag-and-drop and export are server templates, plain JavaScript and SortableJS; tiles draw shared React media cards.
- Implementation: tier board/tile components, `src/static/js/listTiers.js`, SortableJS.
- Contract: moves/order/colors/unranked/fill-from-ratings/undo/export/truncation; editable only for authorized manual non-smart lists.
- Data: `src/lists/views_tiers.py`, `tiers.py`, `tier_export.py`, transactional ordering.
- Reuse/blockers: board state/media values shared; accessible reorder/native export need adapters.
- Validation targets: `src/lists/tests/test_tiers.py`, `test_tier_fill.py`, `test_tier_export.py`, `test_item_rank.py`.

## Settings, identity and integrations

Current settings use `src/users/provider_views.py`/`provider_catalog.py`.
`legacy_settings()` in `src/users/provider_views.py`, wired by `src/users/urls.py`,
redirects old metadata/import/integration/
export/MAL routes to current provider/data/access/activity pages. Retained page
templates are compatibility/composition sources, not equally active parallel pages.

### SET-NAV — Settings layout and media-type preferences

- Shared `ReorderList` renders measured-layout drag handles and accessibility move actions for native `SettingsSidebarView` / `SidebarSettingsSlot` and `HomeScreenEditor` / `HomeSettingsSlot`. Presentation uses React Native primitives and props; browser defaults retain existing controls. Browser: Sidebar drag saved/restored and web order confirmed at 375x812. Home section/row drag still needs verification; server editors remain until full control/visual parity. iOS: Not verified. Android: Not verified. Native readiness: `Primitives`.

- `SettingsView` / `SettingsPage` and native `SettingsScreen` share navigation and page spacing; the Data adapter opts into 24 px section spacing and the web's 20 px subsection title. Native Settings now uses the shared chevron icon and aligns its top content with the Django shell. Remaining consumers and retirement conditions below are unchanged. Browser: settings navigation and Data geometry observed at 375x812; other pages still require their parity passes. iOS: Not verified. Android: Not verified. Native readiness: `Primitives`.

- Purpose/usage: settings sidebar/mobile menu, media-type selection/order.
- Native readiness: `Primitives`. Browser evidence only; no iOS or Android runtime verification.
- Status: `Partial / coexisting`. Browser server templates remain; Expo consumes shared React presentation.
- Implementation: `src/templates/users/base.html`, `sidebar.html`, media-type picker/order-script components.
- Contract: current-page semantics/responsive collapse, enabled types/Discover/order and boosted navigation.
- Data: `src/users/views.py` sidebar/preferences handlers and user config.
- Reuse/blockers: navigation/selection model shared; routing/HTMX/native navigation remain platform boundaries.
- Validation targets: `src/users/tests/views/test_settings_media_tag_filters.py`, `src/users/tests/views/test_onboarding.py`.
- Native presentation: `SettingsView` no longer marks the Providers nav item `availability: 'server'`, because native now reaches Providers. Consumers: web settings shell and native `SettingsScreen`. Native readiness: `Primitives` (react-native primitives, props only; the device gate has not passed, so never `Ready`). Verification: Browser: not run (bundle compile and node/Django tests only; Expo web build with native-variant preview, FLOPPY_PREVIEW_NATIVE=1, pending coordinator visual pass). iOS: Not verified. Android: Not verified.

### SET-PREFERENCES — Preferences and save states

- Shared SelectField has optional trigger, text and label styles used by native ManualEntryView; existing consumers retain their defaults. Browser: manual parent flow exercised in Expo, status geometry recheck pending. iOS and Android not verified; remaining browser preference fallback retires with full parity and adoption. Native readiness: `Primitives`.
- Shared `PreferencesForm`, `SelectField` and `SettingsPreferencesView` own Expo presentation through `PreferencesSlot`: native card frames, icons, boolean dropdowns, card-settings link and docked save bar. `SettingsSaveBarHost` / `SettingsSaveBar` are native viewport adapters around shared `FormSaveBar`, also consumed by Appearance. Home Screen uses an inline save action matching its web form. Browser preferences remain Django/Alpine; retirement requires complete visual/control parity and a browser adapter. Currency save and restore observed in Expo and confirmed on the web at 375x812; section geometry remains partial. iOS: Not verified. Android: Not verified. Native readiness: `Primitives`.

- Purpose/usage: locale/date/time/title/region/general behavior settings.
- Native readiness: `Primitives`. Browser evidence only; no iOS or Android runtime verification.
- Status: `Partial / coexisting`. Server form with inline selectors remains; Expo uses shared React presentation.
- Implementation: `src/templates/users/preferences.html`, inline selectors/help, shared save bar.
- Contract: unsaved/disabled/selected/error states, validation, dirty tracking and polite announcements.
- Data: preferences handler in `src/users/views.py`, `src/users/forms.py` and user fields.
- Reuse/blockers: fields/selection/save model shared; repeated dropdowns consolidate when feasible. Mobile preferences parity unverified.
- Validation targets: `src/users/tests/views/test_preferences.py`.

### SET-APPEARANCE — Theme and detail layout editor

- Custom surface opacity and runtime radius tokens apply in native settings palettes; static module-level radii and true backdrop blur remain incomplete as described under TOKENS. Browser, iOS and Android effect verification pending; the existing web editor remains the owner until parity and shared adoption.
- `AppearanceEditor` and `SettingsAppearanceView` accept a save-bar adapter; native `AppearanceSettingsSlot` uses the docked shared save bar and omits the duplicate page heading. Browser defaults and Django/Alpine consumers remain unchanged; retirement requires full parity. Browser: compared at 375x812, full-size diagonal theme swatches, section framing and page footer observed; Light saved and System default restored with web confirmation. Custom effects and scrolled detail editor parity remain pending. iOS: Not verified. Android: Not verified. Native readiness: `Primitives`.

- Purpose/usage: swatches/custom effects and detail-family section enable/order.
- Native readiness: `Primitives`. Browser evidence only; no iOS or Android runtime verification.
- Status: `Partial / coexisting`. Browser server templates remain; Expo consumes shared React presentation.
- Implementation: `src/templates/users/appearance.html`, inline `appearanceEditor()`/JSON-script config.
- Contract: selection/custom validation, tabs/zones/order and persisted settings.
- Data: `src/users/appearance.py`, appearance handler in `src/users/views.py`.
- Reuse/blockers: tokens/editor state shared; CSS runtime/reorder need platform implementations.
- Validation targets: `src/users/tests/views/test_appearance.py`, `src/app/tests/test_theme_tokens.py`.

### SET-CARDS — Card configuration and preview

- Purpose/usage: per-media line selection/reorder/live preview.
- Status: `Partial / coexisting`. Browser settings remain the server template with its inline Alpine editor. Expo Settings uses the shared React Native `CardsEditor`; its touch-action preference is server-backed, while native per-type profiles remain a local preview.
- Native readiness: `Primitives`. Expo `CardsEditor` uses React Native components; touch-action preference transport is server-backed, while per-type profile persistence remains a local preview.
- Implementation: `src/templates/users/cards.html`, `cards_preview.html`, inline `cardsEditor()`; `frontend/pages/SettingsCardsView.jsx`, `frontend/settings/CardsEditor.jsx`, `native-proof/app/surfaces/CardsSettingsSlot.jsx`.
- Contract: per-type values/default/order and previews consistent with canonical projection.
- Data: `src/users/card_metadata.py`, card settings/preview handlers; `native-proof/app/data/settingsTransport.js` reads and writes `clickable_media_cards` through `/api/v1/user/preferences/`.
- Reuse/blockers: shared schema/state with card; server preview HTML needs adapter.
- Remaining consumers and retirement: the browser keeps the Django/Alpine per-type editor and server preview. Native per-type profile values remain demo-only until a server read/write contract exists; the touch-action preference is already persisted server-side.
- Validation targets: `src/users/tests/views/test_cards.py`, `src/users/tests/test_card_metadata.py`, `native-proof/app/data/transportRoutes.test.mjs`.

### SET-HOME — Home section/shelf editor

- `HomeScreenEditor` and `SettingsHomeView` use shared measured-layout drag handles, parsed media icons, complete filter summaries, color swatch dialog and native page-card framing; native `HomeSettingsSlot` omits the duplicate heading and uses the web's inline save action and Label appearance dropdown. Browser Django/SortableJS consumers remain; retirement requires native reorder and full editor parity. Browser: compared at 375x812; Label appearance Outline saved and Soft restored with web confirmation. Section/row drag and expanded editor parity remain pending. iOS: Not verified. Android: Not verified. Native readiness: `Primitives`.

- Purpose/usage: Home rows/filter/sort/list-backed sections.
- Native readiness: `Primitives`. Browser evidence only; no iOS or Android runtime verification.
- Status: `Partial / coexisting`. Browser server templates remain; Expo consumes shared React presentation.
- Implementation: `src/templates/users/home_screen.html`, inline `homeScreenSettings()`, Alpine/SortableJS.
- Contract: nested order/labels/colors/collapse/menus, owned/collaborator/smart-list search, validation and payload.
- Data: `src/users/home_screen.py`, Home config/search/filter handlers.
- Reuse/blockers: editor model/filters shared; native reorder/drag-versus-click need proof.
- Validation targets: `src/users/tests/views/test_home_screen.py`, `test_home_screen_menus.py`.

### SET-PROVIDERS — Catalog and capability tabs

- Shared ProviderSettingsView and ProviderDetailView receive guidesSessionRequired from the provider adapter. Bearer responses omit credential-bearing webhook/install/configure guides and show password sign-in guidance; other connection forms, settings and browser/session defaults remain. Existing partial/coexisting ownership and full-parity retirement conditions remain. Transport/server regressions cover redaction; browser appearance and actual iOS/Android runtime for this state are not verified.

- Shared TextField has optional input/label styles and a decimal keyboard for native ManualEntryView; existing consumers retain defaults. Browser: manual parent flow exercised in Expo, final form geometry pending. iOS and Android not verified; remaining web fields retire with parity and shared adoption. Native readiness: `Primitives`.
- Native `ProvidersScreen` and `ProviderDetailScreen` reuse `SettingsSurface` for the settings shell. `ProviderDetailView`, `ProviderSettingsView`, `AccountSettings` and `ProviderLinkCard` preserve account/guide order while adapting active OAuth/device sign-in. KOReader's shared settings form occupies AccountSettings formContent; Seerr retains its integration intro and Settings form. CatalogGrantsCard is consumed on Stremio Tracking through CatalogGrantsSlot, with adapter-owned one-time secret slots. These native bodies coexist with the current Django/web adapter consumers; retirement still requires a complete provider body/browser port and acceptance. Browser: Plex, Seerr, KOReader and Hardcover compared at 375x812; Seerr invalid URL rejected and an unchanged blank-key save succeeded; KOReader empty Connect & Import was clicked without credentials; Hardcover blank instance Save was clicked with outcome not yet confirmed. Frame, heading/order and size fixes need a final comparison, so parity remains partial. iOS/Android: this revision has no runtime verification.
- Purpose/usage: current provider browser/detail and status cards.
- Implementation: `frontend/providers/ProviderDirectoryView.jsx` and shared catalog/toolbar controls; `src/templates/users/providers.html` and provider result/card templates provide the server fallback. `provider_detail.html` and provider status/row components retain other consumers. The former Alpine filter-dropdown template has no active directory consumer.
- Contract: query/capability/media, 300ms search/URL/history, supported tabs and connection health.
- Data: `src/users/provider_views.py`, `provider_catalog.py`, `provider_ui.directory_page`; HTML fallback and authenticated private/no-store JSON with explicit presentation fields only.
- Reuse/blockers: catalog/status values shared; do not assume services available standalone.
- Validation targets: `src/users/tests/views/test_provider_navigation.py`, `test_provider_catalog.py`, `test_provider_integration_sections.py`.
- Status: `Partial / coexisting`. `Web Migrated` for the Providers directory and every provider's header, media chips, tabs and Overview. All use `ProviderPage` and data-driven shared cards; AniList also owns Connection, Import and Activity bodies. Other tab bodies remain server-owned siblings with partial shared card consumers. The directory reuses app-wide catalog and filter controls. The server `header_fallback.html` shares the React header's classes (`provider-identity`, `provider-media-chip`, `ui-tabs`) so the mount causes no reflow; media chips sit in the title row itself (wrapping among themselves, never below the title); React-owned tab bodies and unmounted island roots stay hidden until mount (4s CSS reveal as the failure fallback); the activity loader placeholders use the same `settings_card` shell as the loaded partial. Browser-verified only; iOS/Android not verified. See [provider-page ownership and data](provider-pages.md).
- Native readiness: `Primitives`. Shared directory/page/account/credential/guide presentation uses React Native primitives and props; browser behaviors remain in adapters. Current native parity remains partial and the device gate has not passed.
- Verification: 184 targeted provider/credential/model/import/action/OAuth tests and 15 Chromium 151/macOS browser checks passed. The browser checks exercise all four AniList tabs at phone/tablet/desktop widths and six theme states, form submissions, activity diagnostics/actions, fallback and navigation lifecycle. Native not tested.
- Directory verification: 51 targeted Django tests and all 21 provider Chromium checks pass. Directory checks cover container-based columns, combined filters, capability-specific links, Connection status icons, empty results, Back navigation and bundle-failure native form submission. Shared preference/filter menu appearances, typeahead, Escape/click-away and focus return are checked. Desktop dark/mobile light screenshots were reviewed. Native not tested.
- Shared provider structure verification: 121 targeted view/import/model tests and 22 Chromium checks pass. Every catalog Overview is checked against the common model and supported tab links; browser checks compare BoardGameGeek, AniList and a file-only provider, then verify retained credential forms mount beside the shared header. Overview reads stored task state without refreshing or writing it. Native not tested.
- Metadata verification: 131 targeted metadata/default-selection/resolution tests and 24 provider browser checks pass. All Metadata tabs use the shared inline model; fixed primary-source activity, personal-key-only source selection, shared defaults across provider pages and exclusion of stored proxy values are covered. Overview and directory column counts match at phone/intermediate/desktop widths.
- Metadata contribution refinement: shared `FeatureList` rows describe consumed outputs and local activity, including unsupported game outputs for comparison. 74 targeted provider/credential tests and 25 browser checks pass; coverage includes missing/personal artwork keys, public Steam artwork, ScreenScraper instance access without a member login, simplified settings text and responsive feature rows. Native not tested.
- Related work: [#1793](https://github.com/dannyvfilms/Floppy/issues/1793). Deferral: provider-specific forms and navigation remain legacy until scoped ports; native verification remains open.
- Native presentation: new `ProviderDetailView` (frontend/pages), `ProviderImportPanel` and `ProviderActivityList` (frontend/providers); `ProviderPageView` body slots now include `tracking` and `sync`; `ProviderDirectoryView`, `ProviderSettingsView`, `AccountSettings`, `ConnectionSettings`, `SetupGuide` and `ProviderMetadataView` are consumed natively through `ProviderDetailView`. Status: partial/coexisting; web keeps the server pages for these sections (no web mount). Retirement: when the server provider detail mounts `ProviderDetailView`. Not built natively: device-code connect JSON, provider forms, file-import UI. Native readiness: `Primitives` (react-native primitives, props only; the device gate has not passed, so never `Ready`). Verification: Browser: not run (bundle compile and node/Django tests only; Expo web build with native-variant preview, FLOPPY_PREVIEW_NATIVE=1, pending coordinator visual pass). iOS: Not verified. Android: Not verified.

### CONNECTIONS — Sync connections, conflicts and device approval

- Shared ConnectionsView.DeviceApproval accepts a session-required state from ConnectionsScreen. Creating an account-bound device grant requires password-session sign-in; existing list/revoke controls and browser defaults remain. Existing ownership and fallback retirement conditions remain; browser appearance and actual iOS/Android runtime for this state are not verified.

- Native SettingsSurface owns the surrounding settings navigation. ConnectionsView preserves an explicit direction Save, Pause/Resume, operational status, every capability state and user-formatted last-check/conflict labels. Existing server sync sections remain consumers until full parity and a web mount replace them. Browser preview was opened; post-fix comparison and real binding save/restore remain pending. No live device grant was approved. iOS/Android: no runtime verification for this revision.
- Purpose/usage: sync directions, kill switch, conflicts, health and device approval for connected accounts.
- Status: `Partial / coexisting`. `frontend/pages/ConnectionsView.jsx` (`ConnectionsView`) is React-owned shared presentation consumed by native `ConnectionsScreen.jsx`; it has no web mount, so the server pages keep their legacy bodies.
- Implementation: `frontend/pages/ConnectionsView.jsx`, `native-proof/app/screens/ConnectionsScreen.jsx`, `native-proof/app/data/connectionsTransport.js`, `connectionsTransportCore.js`.
- Contract: JSON endpoints under `/api/v1`; trusted-device approval and OAuth hand-offs open the web provider page (not built natively).
- Data: `src/api` provider and sync views; no credentials serialized into presentation props.
- Reuse/blockers: retire the server bodies when the web pages mount `ConnectionsView`.
- Native readiness: `Primitives` (react-native primitives, props only; the device gate has not passed, so never `Ready`).
- Verification: Browser: not run (bundle compile and node/Django tests only; Expo web build with native-variant preview, FLOPPY_PREVIEW_NATIVE=1, pending coordinator visual pass). iOS: Not verified. Android: Not verified.
- Validation targets: `native-proof` `npm run test:transport` (connectionsTransportCore tests), `src/api/tests` provider tests.

### REVIEW-QUEUE — Metadata review queue

- MetadataReviewScreen now reuses the settings shell with Activity active. Candidate/preview/apply ownership and the existing portable MetadataReviewView remain unchanged. Browser queue/decision acceptance is pending; no real decision was removed. Existing server review bodies retire only after full parity. iOS/Android: not verified for this revision.
- Purpose/usage: review queue, candidate search, preview, apply, ignore and remove for metadata matches (not the episode-order tool in `METADATA-REVIEW`).
- Status: `Partial / coexisting`. `frontend/pages/MetadataReviewView.jsx` (`MetadataReviewView`) is React-owned shared presentation consumed by native `MetadataReviewScreen.jsx`; no web mount, so the server page keeps its legacy body.
- Implementation: `frontend/pages/MetadataReviewView.jsx`, `native-proof/app/screens/MetadataReviewScreen.jsx`, `native-proof/app/data/metadataReviewTransport.js`, `metadataReviewTransportCore.js`.
- Contract: queue and candidate payloads from the API; apply and ignore are explicit user actions.
- Data: `src/api` metadata review views.
- Reuse/blockers: retire the server body when the web page mounts `MetadataReviewView`.
- Native readiness: `Primitives` (react-native primitives, props only; the device gate has not passed, so never `Ready`).
- Verification: Browser: not run (bundle compile and node/Django tests only; Expo web build with native-variant preview, FLOPPY_PREVIEW_NATIVE=1, pending coordinator visual pass). iOS: Not verified. Android: Not verified.
- Validation targets: `native-proof` `npm run test:transport` (metadataReviewTransportCore tests).

### SET-METADATA — Credentials, defaults and repair

- Purpose/usage: provider connection/metadata/admin repair.
- Implementation: provider connection/metadata/credential row/modal/status/default/repair components; instance, personal and default shortcut fields are shared by inline Connection and the retained legacy modal in `src/templates/users/metadata.html`.
- Contract: personal/server scope, set/clear/return destination, media defaults/admin checks; never expose existing secrets for convenient display.
- Data: `src/users/metadata_views.py`, credential services/repair handlers.
- Reuse/blockers: field/status reusable; authorization/secrets remain server-owned, mobile endpoint/secret audit required.
- Validation targets: `src/users/tests/views/test_metadata_settings.py`.
- Status: `Partial / coexisting`. `Web Migrated` for every Metadata tab through `Metadata.jsx`, with inline shared source/default forms, anime format, fixed/supplemental explanations, migration actions and TMDB proxy settings. AniList owns instance/personal credential forms and its permission dialog; other credential bodies remain Django forms with shared React headings. Preserve editable/read-only/environment locks; saved values and previews never enter page models.
- Native readiness: `DOM`. Its presentation (`Metadata.jsx`, 79 lines) is React DOM with CSS classes and has 0 browser-API references; a rewrite to `react-native` primitives is owed before native.
- Verification: 78 targeted provider, metadata, sync and import tests passed with `FLOPPY_TEST_FAST_DB=1` (migrations not replayed); Chromium 151 on macOS, system light/dark at 1440×1000 and 390×844, including permission dialog focus and Escape. Native and assistive-technology testing not performed.
- Related work: [#1793](https://github.com/dannyvfilms/Floppy/issues/1793). Deferral: the legacy metadata template retains its modal for compatibility; retire that consumer when the retained legacy template is removed. Native credential transport and secure storage await separate design and the foundation proof.

### SET-IMPORT — Connect, upload and schedule

- Purpose/usage: provider import tabs, reading-server dialogs/schedules.
- Source inventory: shared file import is `frontend/providers/ProviderFileImportView.jsx`;
  `clz_import_fallback.html` is its retained server fallback. Their ownership is
  recorded here; this alphabet change does not alter their migration state.
- Browser adapter repair (#1878): `frontend/providers/transport.web.js` implements a user-gesture chooser for the universal `FilePicker`; `mountFileImport.jsx` supplies browser `File` objects to the form transport. Native picking remains platform-owned. Fallback file forms remain synchronized with saved preferences even across Alpine subtree boundaries, and external provider URLs remain real links.
- Inventory (Playwright and server-render checked; iOS/Android unverified): single-file and
  small upload forms use `FileImport.jsx` through `provider_ui.FILE_IMPORTS` (Yamtrack/Floppy, HLTB,
  Playnite, Grouvee, IMDb, Goodreads, StoryGraph, YouTube, WeTrakr, Hardcover, TV Time, MDBList), with
  `file_import_fallback.html` as the hidden-until-mount fallback. Credentials on every provider
  Connection tab use `Credentials.jsx` (`provider_ui.provider_credentials`). Account-style connections use
  `AccountConnection.jsx` via `provider_views.ACCOUNT_CONNECTIONS` / `INSTANCE_CONNECTIONS` (Kapowarr,
  Mylar, Radarr, Sonarr, GPodder, Pocket Casts, Koito, Last.fm, PSN, Storyteller, Kavita, Komga, Xbox,
  Stremio sign-in, MAL authorize). Webhook setup instructions use `SetupGuide.jsx`
  (`provider_guides.py`: Emby, Kodi, Navidrome, Nuvio, both Jellyfin guides, the Seerr and global Seerr
  guides, the Stremio addon steps; token-bearing URLs and links are read from the server fallback, never
  serialized). Small integration settings forms use `SettingsForm.jsx` (`provider_forms.py`:
  Plex usernames and mark-watched, Jellyfin webhook events, Seerr automation and connection, KOReader
  connect and settings). Hardcover sync, KOReader (Connection tab) and MDBList (Connection tab) use `SettingsForm.jsx`/
  `FileImport.jsx` inline instead of a modal. Plex's Connection tab is the shared webhook card (`SetupGuide.jsx` with a primary copy
  field, status badge/tooltip and collapsed steps; `provider_guides._plex_webhook_badge`) above the shared account
  card (`AccountConnection.jsx` with badges and a single full-width card); the "Set up account access here /
  Open connection setup" header and button no longer render on provider pages. Jellyfin's Connection tab matches it: one webhook card (primary copy field, status tag) with the two plugin
  setups (official, unofficial) as two side-by-side cards below it (one fold each, stacked on phones), and every folded `SetupGuide.jsx` guide
  (Plex, Jellyfin, Emby, Seerr) now renders as two cards, status and copy field first, steps second, with a 1rem gap
  (`.ui-guide-stack`, and a margin between separate guide roots). Emby's and Seerr's guides are folded with a primary copy field (the Jellyfin official
  guide shows a "Needs update" badge when the template is outdated and warns KefinTweaks users that its watchlist
  rating of 1 is not a real rating, so they should remove the Rating field from the template; no last-received
  badge because Floppy stores no Jellyfin webhook timestamp, so adding one needs a user-model migration), above the shared
  `AccountConnection.jsx` card (`provider_views`, new `editable` flag: connected accounts get an "Edit connection"
  toggle that re-submits server URL, API key and username, prefilled from non-secret fields; the API key is never
  serialized). Status: React-owned on browser (Connection tab), verified in the browser only; iOS and Android not
  verified. The KefinTweaks copy addition is covered by the server-render guide test; it changes no layout or styling.
  Remaining legacy, with blockers: Jellyfin Import/Sync/Tracking cards and the Emby/Kodi Sync push forms
  (per-tab conditional flags share one POST that must preserve the other tab's flags, covered by
  `test_provider_integration_sections`; reopen when those flags move to `provider_forms`); Kodi, Navidrome and Nuvio
  guides stay expanded (their URL sits mid-step, not a plain "set the URL" step; reopen when the step copy is split). Remaining legacy, each with a
  concrete blocker: Plex libraries picker and webhook sharing (Tracking/Import tabs; live library fetch,
  per-share Alpine state); Jellyfin account/push controls (conditional per-tab
  states); Stremio addon catalog grants (htmx status); the same-tab modal copies of upload and connection forms used outside provider pages. Retire each by moving it to a `provider_forms` or
  `provider_guides` entry. Masked credential previews are not serialized to React; the fallback still
  shows them.
- Implementation: provider-import/schedule/game-sync/Plex-selector/upload-badge components, `users/_reading_server_card.html`, `_reading_server_modal.html`; retained import page.
- Contract: connect/disconnect/import/upload/schedule, provider-specific fields/library/content kinds, errors/busy state.
- Data: import context/settings in `src/users/views.py`, `src/integrations/views.py`, account/task records.
- Reuse/blockers: field/status/schedule primitives; keep distinct provider flows/server-required jobs.
- Validation targets: `src/users/tests/views/test_import_data.py`, `src/integrations/tests/test_plex_import_views.py`.
- Status: `Partial / coexisting`. `Web Migrated` for AniList preferences, serialized auto-save, public username import and credential-gated private OAuth form. Uses app-wide fields/selects/buttons/card grid and a reusable Public/Private `ToggleChip`; provider code retains authentication semantics. Other providers share the React import-preferences island while their provider-specific forms remain Django-owned; data management retains its restore dialog. Activity lists use bounded scrolling and provider pins are persisted per user. Native verification remains pending.
- Native readiness: `DOM`. Its presentation (`AccountConnection.jsx`, `Credentials.jsx`, `FileImport.jsx`, `SettingsForm.jsx`, `SetupGuide.jsx`, 333 lines) is React DOM with CSS classes and has 8 browser-API references; a rewrite to `react-native` primitives is owed before native.
- Verification: targeted provider catalog and import tests cover scheduling, credentials, uploads and scoped activity; Chromium on macOS checked AniList, Pocket Casts and Playnite at desktop and phone widths in dark mode. Native not tested.
- Related work: [#1793](https://github.com/dannyvfilms/Floppy/issues/1793). Deferral: native upload, scheduling and server-job adapters await the foundation proof and separately authorized client work.

### SET-ACTIVITY — Import and operational activity

- Native-only pageCards rendering supplies 24 px section frames, 20 px icon headings, rounded source/run rows, separate formatted dates, wrapped counts, red text actions and singular/plural cleanup labels. The coordinator refreshed the final Django/Expo populated pair after these corrections and observed matching run-card structure, icon headers, status/date/count rows and red Undo link. A real local one-row CSV import generated the displayed receipt/counts/date. All four empty MAL tabs were exercised with matching copy; Undo and source Delete confirmations were opened and cancelled. Level-2 headings, explicit selected state and named tabpanel preserve accessibility. Only this disposable receipt and its history/provenance were removed after the comparison; baseline data was preserved. Connected MAL and outbound provider workflows remain unverified without a configured account. Existing web presentation defaults/ownership remain unchanged; iOS/Android have no runtime verification for these changes.
- Purpose/usage: activity/run details/cancel/rollback/cleanup/outbound status.
- Implementation: `frontend/providers/ProviderActivityView.jsx` and shared settings cards, alongside `src/templates/users/provider_activity.html`, import loader/activity/cleanup and integration/outbound activity components. Provider activity uses React card headers with Django-owned body slots until those controls are migrated.
- Contract: five-second polling pauses swaps while `[data-keep-open=true]` details are expanded and preserves bounded list scroll positions; preserve pending/running/result/error, copying and action permissions. Task history and import runs are separate records; runs expose counts and undo where supported.
- Data: provider activity handler, ImportRun/tasks and cancel/rollback/cleanup handlers.
- Reuse/blockers: status/activity presentation shared; transport/job control adapters must not erase user work on refresh.
- Validation targets: `src/users/tests/views/test_cancel_import_run.py`, `test_cancel_pending_import.py`, `test_rollback_import_run.py`.
- Status: `Partial / coexisting`. `Web Migrated` for AniList scoped schedules, paged history, run actions and source cleanup. React owns polling and preserves expanded diagnostics. Other provider/central Activity surfaces retain their current records/actions and templates.
- Native readiness: `Primitives`. ProviderActivityView and SettingsActivityView use React Native primitives; transport, permissions, polling requests and confirmation decisions remain in their adapters. Current iOS/Android verification is open.
- Verification: scoped JSON tests cover exact ownership, pagination and token exclusion; existing cancel/undo/source cleanup tests pass. Chromium 151/macOS checks polling pause, error details and schedule removal returning to Activity. Native not tested.
- Related work: [#1793](https://github.com/dannyvfilms/Floppy/issues/1793). Deferral: native activity transport and job controls await separate client work and the foundation proof.
- Native Expo page: `frontend/pages/SettingsActivityView.jsx` with `native-proof/app/surfaces/ActivitySettingsSlot.jsx` consumes the shared ProviderActivityView for bounded all-source schedules, history, run counts/actions and source cleanup. The account-scoped API supplies real MAL Sync/Mapping Issues/Manual Mappings/Ignored states, mapping search/save/ignore/restore/revert/retry controls and TMDb/WeTrakr delivery counts/recent results. Existing web services enforce every mutation; scoped import readers do not gain tracker access. Browser verification covers the four empty MAL tabs, the final real populated import receipt, and confirmation cancellation. Connected-provider flows await an account, and iOS/Android are unverified. The central Django and non-AniList provider bodies remain until a full browser port and acceptance.

### SET-SYNC — Integrations, outbound sync and health

- Purpose/usage: provider integration/sync/service tabs.
- Implementation: `src/templates/users/providers/integration_content.html`, service integration/MAL/outbound fragments, sync/scrobble/conflict/status/modals.
- Contract: webhook/library/user choices, connected/broken distinction, directions/conflicts/kill switches and provider instructions.
- Data: `src/users/views.py`, `src/integrations/state/settings_view.py`, integration actions; connection-health contract applies.
- Reuse/blockers: status/fields shared; background integrations require server capabilities and distinct provider semantics.
- Validation targets: `src/integrations/tests/test_sync_settings.py`, `src/users/tests/views/test_provider_sync_templates.py`.
- Status: `Partial / coexisting`. The small integration settings forms (Plex usernames and mark-watched, Jellyfin webhook events, Seerr automation and connection) are React `SettingsForm` islands, inventoried under SET-IMPORT; the Sync, Tracking and Import tab bodies and the MAL and outbound sections stay Django. Watched-state configuration is on the supported media server Sync tabs; Activity surfaces conflicts when present. Provider-scoped MAL and outbound sections use the provider shell's surface.
- Native readiness: `n/a`. No React presentation of its own; it composes the components of other entries.
- Verification: the 78 targeted tests above include `test_provider_sync_templates`; Chromium 151 on macOS at desktop and phone widths in system light/dark covered the disconnected MAL Sync page, but not a connected outbound account. Native not tested.
- Related work: [#1793](https://github.com/dannyvfilms/Floppy/issues/1793). Deferral: native sync settings and server integration adapters await the foundation proof.

### SET-DATA — Export/restore, danger zone and RSS

- Shared RssFeedCard accepts a session-required model from DataSettingsSlot. Bearer clients show password sign-in guidance instead of a credential-bearing RSS URL; other Data cards and browser/session defaults remain. Existing ownership and retirement conditions remain; transport checks cover denial handling, while browser appearance and actual iOS/Android runtime for this state are not verified.

- `ExportScheduleCard`, `ExportOtherSitesCard`, `ScheduledExportsCard`, `ExportHistoryCard` and `LibraryMaintenanceCard` remain shared React Native presentation, consumed by `DataSettingsSlot`; the Django Data body stays server-owned. Native supplies the same export/external/repeat/history icon shapes as the web. Repair visibility comes from the caller's `duplicate_anime_count` through the API; TV conversion remains on provider metadata surfaces. Data is still partial: restore/RSS placement, remaining control typography and lower sections need browser parity. Retire the legacy body only after those controls preserve web behavior and permissions. Browser: paired 375x812 inspection of Data; iOS: Not verified; Android: Not verified. Native readiness: `Primitives`.

- Purpose/usage: data management and RSS builder/preview.
- Status: `Partial / coexisting`. The backup destination and freshness paragraphs of `export_controls.html` are React-owned (`frontend/settings/BackupStatus.jsx`, see the backup bullet below); the schedule form, export, danger zone, RSS and the rest of the page stay legacy.
- Native readiness: `DOM`. Its presentation (`BackupStatus.jsx`, 17 lines) is React DOM with CSS classes and has 0 browser-API references; a rewrite to `react-native` primitives is owed before native.
- Implementation: `src/templates/users/data_management.html`, `rss.html`, export/danger controls; retained export pages.
- Contract: content eligibility/schedules/download history/restore/repair, destructive confirmation/ownership; RSS copy/preview skips planning/collected filters.
- Data: provider data-management and export/delete/RSS handlers in `src/users/views.py`.
- Reuse/blockers: selection/warning/status shared; download/clipboard/feed/restore are platform/server boundaries.
- Validation targets: `src/users/tests/views/test_export_schedule.py`, `test_bulk_delete_by_import_source.py`, `test_rss.py`.
- Backup status (#1627): the destination/freshness paragraphs of `export_controls.html` are React-owned (`frontend/settings/BackupStatus.jsx`, partial/coexisting — the schedule form and the rest of the page stay legacy). Server fallback retained inside `data-backup-status-root`; sections are built and translated by `users.views.backup_panel_props`. Retirement: when the export form itself is ported. Browser verification: Chromium via the isolated bench server, empty-history state mounted and rendered both sections; failure and PostgreSQL states covered by unit tests only. iOS/Android: not tested.
- Native presentation: `DataSettings.jsx` gains `LibraryMaintenanceCard` and `SettingsDataView` an optional `maintenance` prop. Consumer: native `DataSettingsSlot` only; web does not pass `maintenance`. Native readiness of the new card: `Primitives`. Verification: Browser: not run (bundle compile and node/Django tests only; Expo web build with native-variant preview, FLOPPY_PREVIEW_NATIVE=1, pending coordinator visual pass). iOS: Not verified. Android: Not verified.
- Native presentation: `DataSettings.jsx` gains `ExportOtherSitesCard` (Letterboxd) and `ImportSettingsCard`, `ExportScheduleCard` takes `backup` sections (`BackupStatus`), and `SettingsDataView` takes `sites` and `importSettings`; consumer native `DataSettingsSlot` only (React status: React-owned on native, no web consumer). `ToggleChip` draws the web switch when the palette supplies `thumb` (native settings palettes) and keeps the chip form otherwise, so browser islands are unchanged. `ProviderDetailView` now renders the detail payload's `forms` (`ProviderSettingsFormView`), the file import (`ProviderFileImportView`) and `ImportPreferencesCard` on the native Import tab; `ProviderImportPanel` takes `hasFileImport`. `ReleaseCalendar` blank days use `surfaceMuted` at 0.4 opacity like the web grid. Page copy for Cards, Data, Advanced, Users, About, Appearance and Preferences headings and the onboarding summary/media labels now follow the web templates. Verification: Browser: Expo web at phone width against the web page, writes exercised and restored (import settings, Jellyfin events form, Goodreads override mode). iOS: Not verified. Android: Not verified.
- Native presentation: new `ProviderLinkCard` (frontend/providers; consumer `ProviderDetailView` via the native `ProviderDetailScreen` only) connects Trakt, Storyteller and WeTrakr with an in-app device code (reusing `DeviceConnectCard`) and Trakt/Simkl/Plex/MAL/AniList/TMDb through a browser sign-in that returns by the app scheme. Status: React-owned on native, no web consumer (web keeps the server provider pages). Retirement: when the server detail mounts `ProviderDetailView`. `ProviderDetailView` also gains the file-import progress/result line and the Media Server Scrobbles option form; `ConnectionSettings` says "Personal key removed" when a personal key is saved blank. Verification: Browser: Expo web preview checked (see docs/plans/round2/settings.md). iOS: Not verified. Android: Not verified.

### SET-ACCESS — Tokens, grants and OAuth approval

- `AccessTokenCard`, `AppTokensCard` and `CatalogGrantsCard` accept a session-required state from the native adapters. Bearer sign-in displays the password sign-in message for account-token disclosure and credential creation while retaining token/application lists and revocation. Browser defaults and the existing partial/coexisting ownership stay unchanged; server fallbacks retire only after full parity. Transport tests cover the account-token fetch boundary; browser appearance and actual iOS/Android runtime for this state are not verified.

- Install credentials retain CatalogGrantsCard presentation but their native consumer is Stremio Tracking through `native-proof/app/surfaces/CatalogGrantsSlot.jsx`, matching the browser integration surface. AccessSettingsSlot no longer fetches or renders catalog grants. The native adapter keeps the one-time credential in a ref, passes metadata plus secretSlot, retains it on copy failure/cancel, and clears it on matching revocation/unmount. API lifecycle is tested in the test database; no live credential was created or revoked, and browser placement/final geometry remain partial. Existing browser grant templates remain until their complete shared port; iOS/Android are not verified for this revision.
- Shared `AccessTokenCard`, `AppTokensCard`, `AuthorizedApplicationsCard` and `SettingsAccessView` support native Access framing, translated web copy, collapsed token creation, checkbox scopes and an Authorized applications subpage. `SettingsScreen`, `DataAccessNotificationsSlot` and `AccessSettingsSlot` own navigation and transport. Credential values are rendered in adapter-owned React slots, never serialized into presentation models; one-time secrets remain only in adapter memory. Browser: blank-name validation, expiry and read-only permission selection exercised at 375x812; live creation awaits action-time browser approval. Install-credential placement and application-page geometry remain partial. Remaining server bodies retire only after full parity. iOS: Not verified. Android: Not verified.

- Purpose/usage: access settings, application/device authorization.
- Status: `Partial / coexisting`. Native token/grant/application cards use shared React Native presentation; Access and application-list browser templates remain server-owned. Device approval has a shared React island and server fallback.
- Native readiness: `Primitives`. Current native changes have browser-preview evidence only.
- Implementation: access-token/integration-token/catalog-grant components, `src/templates/integrations/oauth_applications.html`, `oauth_device.html`.
- Contract: one-time secret, scope/expiry/copy/revoke, grants and device approve/deny.
- Data: token/grant handlers, `src/integrations/oauth_management.py`, `oauth_device.py`.
- Reuse/blockers: fields/status shared; secure native storage/auth lifecycle separately designed, never credentials in shared presentation.
- Validation targets: `src/users/tests/views/test_integration_tokens.py`, `src/integrations/tests/test_oauth_device_flow.py`.
- First-party approval: the built-in Floppy app requests full account access and receives explicit consent wording; other applications retain the unverified-client warning and scoped permission list. `DeviceApproval` renders the browser approval island with a server fallback; account/method guards and first-party scope wording are tested. Browser approval remains a platform boundary and does not establish device verification.

### AUTH — Authentication and account security

- Shared `PasswordCard`, `AuthenticatorCard` and `RecoveryCodesCard` accept a session-required state from `AuthScreen`. Bearer account payloads retain profile/username access but withhold authenticator bootstrap and password/recovery actions; the cards display password sign-in guidance. Defaults preserve session and browser consumers. Server-rendering checks cover both states; browser appearance and actual iOS/Android runtime for this state are not verified. Ownership remains partial/coexisting, with existing server consumers retained until full parity.

- Native Settings embeds `AuthScreen` in account mode through `SettingsScreen`, using shared `SettingsAccountView` / `AccountSecurityView`. `AuthenticatorCard` accepts shared `RecoveryCodesCard` content so recovery stays in the same card; native Settings hides the separate sign-out and connection actions. Browser account remains server-owned until full parity. Browser: account route verified at 375x812; empty password/authenticator/recovery submissions rejected without credential changes. Exact visual parity remains partial. iOS: Not verified. Android: Not verified. Native readiness: Primitives.

- Purpose/usage: login/signup/social/password/TOTP/recovery/deletion.
- Status: `Partial / coexisting`. Browser authentication and account security remain server-rendered allauth/account templates. The native-proof sign-in and account screen use shared `AuthView`, `AuthEntrance` and account cards.
- Native readiness: `Primitives`. Shared auth presentation uses React Native primitives; server discovery, auth transport and secure session storage stay in native/platform adapters. DNS-SD runtime has not been exercised on iOS or Android.
- Implementation: `frontend/auth/AuthEntrance.jsx`, `frontend/pages/AuthView.jsx`, `native-proof/app/screens/AuthScreen.jsx`, platform server-discovery adapters, and `src/templates/account/`, `allauth/`, `socialaccount/`, `users/account.html`, `password_recover.html`.
- Contract: errors/redirects/social connections, password/QR/recovery codes, identity-confirmed deletion/demo/last-superuser guards; no email/SMS recovery implied.
- Data: allauth, `src/users/forms.py`, signup/account/recovery handlers, public `/accounts/auth-config/` check for discovered Floppy services.
- First-party device sign-in: the native device flow signs in as the server-defined Floppy app client (`authTransportCore.js`), records full account access from the granted scope, and shows the password sign-in explanation only for tokens without it. Account security reaches `/api/v1/user/account/` with a bearer token (`authAccountCore.js`); session sign-ins keep `/settings/account`. No presentation component changed (`AuthScreen.jsx` only updates its screen note). Validation: `npm run test:transport` (auth transport and account transport tests). Browser, iOS and Android: not verified.
- Reuse/blockers: native sign-in separates server selection/check/discovery from credentials, then shows the chosen address with a Change action. Manual entry remains available; Local/Remote mode toggles without changing the entered address and suggests `http://floppy.local:8000` locally or `floppy.example.com` remotely. Expo Go shows a brief notice because it cannot browse DNS-SD. Local discovery scans `_http._tcp` advertisements marked as Floppy, then verifies candidates through the public auth-config endpoint. The server-side advertiser is an opt-in Linux Docker host-network sidecar; other deployment modes keep manual entry.
- Remaining consumers/retirement: all browser auth/account templates and allauth controls stay server-owned. Revisit their migration only when browser auth presentation is separately authorized and parity-ready.
- Verification: browser auth remains the existing server-rendered implementation. Earlier Expo Go checks on iOS 27.2 covered the single address action, clear behavior, brief Expo Go discovery notice, Local/Remote suggestions, and compact Remote info control. The two-step server/credentials flow compiles in the iOS Expo export but remains unverified at runtime because Device Hub continued showing the previous bundle after reload and the Expo server reports networking disabled. Native DNS-SD discovery and Android runtime verification remain pending.
- Validation targets: `src/app/tests/test_discovery_advertiser.py`, `native-proof/app/data/serverDiscoveryCore.test.mjs`, `native-proof/app/data/authTransportCore.test.mjs`, `src/users/tests/views/test_signup.py`, `src/users/tests/test_delete_account.py`, `test_demo_account_guard.py`.
- Native presentation: `AuthEntrance` gains a `serverLocked` prop that hides the server row on web. Consumers: native app entrance, Settings account, web adapter `authTransport.web.js`. Native readiness stays `Primitives`. Verification: Browser: not run (bundle compile and node/Django tests only; Expo web build with native-variant preview, FLOPPY_PREVIEW_NATIVE=1, pending coordinator visual pass). iOS: Not verified. Android: Not verified.

### SET-NOTIFICATIONS — Notification preferences/exclusions

- `NotificationPreferencesCard`, `ExcludedMediaCard`, `SettingsNotificationsView` and native `NotificationsSettingsSlot` share React Native presentation, with native page-card framing, title icons, field/help order and inline actions. `TextField` adds opt-in trailing help. Browser Django/HTMX remains the consumer to retire after complete visual/control parity. Daily Digest save and restore observed in Expo and confirmed on the web; help panel opened/closed and The Matrix exclusion added/removed with web confirmation. Artwork/type labels and new row icons need a final rendered pass; detailed spacing remains partial. iOS: Not verified. Android: Not verified. Native readiness: `Primitives`.

- Purpose/usage: release/premiere/digest/test and media exclusion list.
- Native readiness: `Primitives`. Browser evidence only; no iOS or Android runtime verification.
- Status: `Partial / coexisting`. Server template with HTMX search remains; Expo uses shared React cards.
- Implementation: `src/templates/users/notifications.html`, search-results/excluded-items components.
- Contract: save/choice/error/test feedback, 300ms search and include/exclude refresh.
- Data: notification/test/search/exclusion handlers and delivery jobs.
- Reuse/blockers: selection/search/exclusion shared; delivery/scheduling remains server capability.
- Validation targets: `src/users/tests/views/test_notifications.py`.

### ONBOARDING — Resumable first-run setup

- Native OnboardingScreen consumes OnboardingView, OnboardingWizard, OnboardingMediaTypesStep and OnboardingServiceSetupStep through optional standalone/reorder/connection slots. App/ShellSlot omit the global header, while the screen omits duplicate chrome. Hero/progress/card and parsed-icon drag/switch rows follow the existing first step; order stays local until Continue. Inline forms/uploads reuse existing source handlers via the full-account connect_service action; OAuth/device flows use the provider adapter and reload on return. The web templates remain their current owner and their shared defaults are preserved; retirement requires a complete browser wizard port and acceptance. Browser: refreshed 375x812 Django/Expo pair confirmed standalone shell, logo, drag handles/icons and switches. TV Shows toggled off/on with aria-checked false/true; original selections were restored without Continue/provider save. Partial visual differences remain: native's already-18px title wraps, and progress/card starts 4px higher. Later steps/connected providers were not exercised and no provider keys entered. iOS/Android: no runtime verification. Native shared presentation is Primitives, not Ready.
- Purpose/usage: media/metadata/services wizard, connection/upload/OAuth/Trakt variants/banner.
- Status: `Legacy`. Server wizard templates; they use `Button` and `Badge`.
- Implementation: `src/templates/users/onboarding/`, onboarding-banner component; shared media-type picker.
- Contract: persisted resume/restart/skip/next, connect/import status, Plex instructions and device fallback.
- Data: `src/users/onboarding_views.py`, `src/integrations/onboarding.py`, user state/ImportRun.
- Reuse/blockers: wizard/controls shared; standalone onboarding needs separately approved capabilities.
- Validation targets: `src/users/tests/views/test_onboarding.py`, `src/integrations/tests/test_onboarding.py`.

### SET-SYSTEM — Advanced, About, updates and install

- `CacheManagementCard` keeps the complete parenthesized provider-cache description in shared `AdvancedSettings`, server props and the Advanced fallback. The server-rendering regression covers this copy. Ownership remains fully React-owned for the island and coexisting with the surrounding server page; complete page parity remains the retirement condition. Browser layout and iOS/Android runtime for this copy revision are not verified.

- Shared `SettingsAboutView` consumes translated labels/icons from the API and native page framing; `AboutSpecificationPreview` in `AboutSettings.jsx` uses shared Modal, CopyBlock, Spinner and Button primitives. `AboutSettingsSlot` owns schema transport, original-text preview/download, browser clipboard/native sharing and platform install selection. Browser preview verification pending. Existing About browser cards remain React-owned inside the server shell; full retirement requires complete page parity. iOS: Not verified. Android: Not verified. Native readiness: Primitives.

- Native `AdvancedSettingsSlot` wraps shared `SettingsAdvancedView` / `AdvancedSettings` cards in the shared page-card variant; translated labels and parsed icons come from the existing account-scoped API. Checkbox selected state now exposes aria-checked. Browser: six cache confirmations opened/cancelled; invalid port rejected, original input restored; image caching enabled then disabled with hydrated web confirmation. No cache clear or port mutation executed. Browser Advanced island remains React-owned and surrounding server shell remains coexisting; retirement requires full page parity. iOS: Not verified. Android: Not verified. Native readiness: Primitives.

- Purpose/usage: administration/server info/release/install feedback.
- Status: `Legacy`. Server templates; the release notes use `Badge`.
- Implementation: `src/templates/users/advanced.html`, `about.html`, server-port/update-banner/whats-new components.
- Contract: cache/image controls/confirmations/log download/port restrictions, deferred releases and install/API links.
- Logs card: `LogsCard` in `frontend/settings/AdvancedSettings.jsx` (React-owned, shared with `native-proof/app/screens/SettingsAdvancedScreen.jsx`) shows Download Sanitized Logs to superusers and Download Diagnostic Report to every signed-in user. Server contract: `src/users/diagnostics.py`, `export_diagnostics`. Browser verification of the new button: pending. iOS/Android: not verified; the native screen is a stub that waits and shows a message.
- Data: advanced/about/release handlers, `src/users/server_port_views.py`.
- Reuse/blockers: mostly web/server composition; share action/warning/status primitives rather than whole admin screens.
- Validation targets: `src/users/tests/views/test_server_port.py`, `src/users/tests/views/test_image_cache.py`, `src/users/tests/views/test_about.py`.

### SET-SIDEBAR — Settings sidebar page

- Purpose/usage: choose visible media types, their order and the Discover switch.
- Status: `Partial / coexisting`. `SettingsSidebarView` is React-owned for the Expo app (`SidebarSettingsSlot`); the web page stays the Django `sidebar.html`. Native reordering uses shared measured-layout drag handles and accessibility move actions; saved/restored order was browser-verified against Django.
- Implementation: `frontend/pages/SettingsSidebarView.jsx`, `native-proof/app/surfaces/SidebarSettingsSlot.jsx`, `GET/PUT /api/v1/user/sidebar/` (now also `order`, `labels`, `icons`, `show_discover`).
- Native readiness: `Primitives`. `react-native` primitives and theme tokens only; no browser API.
- Verification: Browser: Compared with the web page in a browser at 375px through the Expo web build's native-variant preview (saved and restored an order). iOS: Not verified. Android: Not verified.
- Retirement: when the web page mounts the shared view.
- Settings Activity: `SettingsActivityView` is the native Activity page with Connections and Matching review entries. Status: Partial / coexisting; native readiness `Primitives`; the web outbound sync and MAL mapping sections are not rebuilt. Verification: Browser: Compared with the web page in a browser at 375px through the Expo web build's native-variant preview. iOS: Not verified. Android: Not verified.

### ACTION-ICONS — Shared icon specs

- Purpose/usage: icon shapes (same as `app/icons/*.svg`) for shared components; `chevronDown` added for the select caret. `MediaCardActions` draws an action's `icon` spec when it has one.
- Status: `Web Migrated`. Data module read by shared components on every surface. Consumers: Music actions, list card settings action, collection copies, tier board, `SelectField`, history, people toolbar, detail, discover, search.
- Native readiness: `Primitives`. Pure icon data.
- Verification: Browser: Compared with the web page in a browser at 375px through the Expo web build's native-variant preview. iOS: Not verified. Android: Not verified.
- Additions in the final visual round: `pieChart` (same shape as `app/icons/piechart.svg`, used by `ListDetailScreen`), plus play, pause, stop, refresh, calendar, funnel, chevronRight, chevronsLeft, chevronsRight, bookmarkPlus, eyeOff, fourSquare and list. Consumers: ListDetailScreen, DetailPage, DetailEpisode, HistoryFeed, PeopleToolbar, SearchResults, DiscoverScreen, StatisticsSummary.

### MATCH-REVIEW — Integration match correction

- Purpose/usage: unmatched/incorrect media review.
- Status: `Legacy`. Server template with a plain JavaScript review script; uses `Button`.
- Implementation: `src/templates/integrations/match_fix.html`, `src/static/js/matchFixReview.js`.
- Contract: filters/candidates/chosen identity, POST/error and retained tracking semantics.
- Data: integration views and `src/integrations/match_corrections.py`.
- Reuse/blockers: shared selection/review pattern; distinct correction semantics and permissions remain explicit.
- Validation targets: `src/integrations/tests/test_matching_and_corrections.py`.

### INTEGRATION-PANELS — Library/download and Seerr requests

- Purpose/usage: detail Arr/Seerr status/request actions.
- Status: `Legacy`. Server panels with HTMX swaps; Arr and Seerr status use `Badge`.
- Implementation: `src/templates/integrations/library_panel.html`, `seerr_request.html`, `seerr_status.html`.
- Contract: nearest-panel replacement, instance/media/season/episode, copy feedback, per-season request/status, permissions/provider errors and parent modal close state.
- Data: `src/integrations/arr_library.py` and integration handlers.
- Reuse/blockers: status/actions shared; parent Alpine/HTMX coupling must be removed deliberately; server capabilities required.
- Validation targets: owning integration view tests; browser/native lifecycle unverified.

### DEVICE-CONNECT — Trakt/device-code connection

- Purpose/usage: provider connection and onboarding handoff.
- Status: `Legacy`. Server template with inline polling; no React component.
- Implementation: `src/templates/integrations/trakt_device_code.html`, onboarding Trakt consumer.
- Contract: start/poll/code/expiry/redirect and useful errors.
- Data: device-code handlers in `src/integrations/views.py`, account state.
- Reuse/blockers: display/state shared; system browser/deep link/native credentials require explicit design.
- Validation targets: provider/device tests; native handoff unverified.

- Native presentation: `DeviceApprovalCard` (frontend/ui, adapter `mountDeviceApproval.jsx`; consumer `src/templates/integrations/oauth_device.html` through `oauth_device`) is the React-owned OAuth device approval page (code entry, unverified-application or full-access notice, requested permissions, Allow/Deny), with the server template kept as fallback. Status: partial/coexisting (web React over fallback). Approval logic is unchanged: Allow/Deny submit the existing CSRF POST. Browser: verified at 375px against the fallback. iOS/Android: not verified (no native consumer).

- Native presentation: `CardsEditor` (frontend/settings; consumers `SettingsCardsView`, native `CardsSettingsSlot`) gained an optional `renderPreview` slot and a `footnote` label; the native slot renders the real shared `MediaCard` from `POST /api/v1/user/cards/preview/` (the same card the web preview draws) instead of the placeholder. Web unchanged (neither prop is passed there). Browser (Expo web): seen at 375px; iOS/Android: not verified.

### STREMIO — Standalone addon configuration

- Purpose/usage: configuration outside standard shell.
- Status: `Legacy`. Standalone server page with an imperative inline script; no React component. Assess a web-only exception when it is next touched.
- Implementation: `src/templates/integrations/stremio_configure.html`, imperative inline script/independent HTML.
- Contract: publish toggles, reorder/accessible labels and generated configuration.
- Data: addon configuration context/endpoints.
- Reuse/blockers: assess explicit web-only exception when touched; do not omit or force into native shell assumptions.
- Validation targets: Stremio integration tests; browser/native parity unverified.

### MIGRATION — Page compositions and adapters awaiting cataloguing

- Status: `Partial / coexisting`
- Native readiness: `Primitives` for the page views; platform adapters stay per-platform.
- Purpose/usage: shared page compositions, native transports and page-level adapters added while the page families converge on the web compositions. This entry keeps every file discoverable in the source map; it is not a claim that every listed file has finished native runtime verification.
- Catalogued components: AboutOverviewCard, AboutVersionFooter, AccessTokenCard, AccountSecurityView, AccountSettings, AccountTypeCard, ActivityList, AlphabetEmpty, ApiCheatSheet, ApiDocCommand, ApiDocs, ApiDocsView, ApiGlossary, ApiSchemaLinks, AppTokensCard, AppearanceEditor, ArrLibraryPanels, ArtworkImage, ArtworkPicker, AttributionsCard, AuthEntrance, AuthNotice, AuthView, AuthenticatorCard, AuthorizedApplicationsCard, BulkActionBar, BulkActionDialog, BulkActionRow, BulkEpisodeForm, BulkFieldRow, BulkJobCard, BulkJobDock, BulkJobMessage, BulkJobProblems, BulkJobProgress, BulkJobSummary, BulkNote, BulkOptionRow, CacheManagementCard, CacheStatusCard, CalendarView, CardScrim, CardsEditor, CatalogCard, CatalogGrantsCard, CatalogGrid, CheckInState, CollectionBrowser, CollectionCopyDialog, CollectionCopyEditor, CollectionCopySummary, CollectionFieldManager, CollectionFieldValueInputs, CollectionSeasonCascade, CollectionView, ComboField,

### PAGE — Page composition chrome
- `PageHeading` accepts optional `titleStyle`/`countStyle` overrides; native `LibraryPageView` uses them for the library's existing typography and mobile count spacing. Defaults and all other consumers are unchanged. Shared RN presentation is `Partial / coexisting`, native readiness `Primitives`; browser spacing re-verification is pending, iOS and Android runtime are not verified. Page-specific server headings retire only with their own composition migrations.

- Status: `Partial / coexisting`
- Native readiness: `Primitives` for the shared controls; browser adapters stay per-platform.
- Purpose/usage: Shared page chrome, headings and page-level adapters.

### SET-USERS — User management

- `UsersManagement` receives a session-required capability from `UsersSlot`: bearer users retain permitted list/filter/delete behavior while account creation, privilege changes and password reset require password-session sign-in. Shared defaults preserve web/session controls. Server-rendering checks cover guidance and controls; browser appearance and actual iOS/Android runtime for this state are not verified. Existing ownership, server fallback and full-parity retirement conditions remain unchanged.

- Native `UsersSlot` omits the duplicate heading; shared `UsersManagement` uses the native page variant and shared chevron icons. Shared `TextField` / `SelectField` use the supplied field-border token. Browser: empty Create user rejected; current-account password dialog opened without entering a credential and cancelled. Existing credentials/roles unchanged. Browser adapter and remaining server fallback remain until full visual/control parity. iOS: Not verified. Android: Not verified. Native readiness: Primitives.

- Status: `Partial / coexisting`
- Native readiness: `Primitives` for the shared controls; browser adapters stay per-platform.
- Purpose/usage: User list, create/edit/password and delete surfaces.

### BULK_ACTIONS — Bulk actions and job dock

- Status: `Partial / coexisting`
- Native readiness: `Primitives` for the shared controls; browser adapters stay per-platform.
- Purpose/usage: Bulk selection actions, toolbar and background job dock.
- Native presentation: `BulkActionBar.native.jsx` adds `onSelectAll`, `selectAllDisabled` and `selecting` (the web file already had them). Consumer: native `ListDetailScreen`. Native readiness stays `Primitives`. Verification: Browser: not run (bundle compile and node/Django tests only). iOS: Not verified. Android: Not verified.
- Web `BulkActionBar` icon sizing: the Status, List and More ActionMenu triggers now take the same 2.5rem box, 6px radius and 1rem glyph as the Collection and Tag buttons (`controls.css`). Browser: screenshot of the select-items bar after the change. iOS/Android: no change needed (native renders every action at one `Icon` size and one 40pt box); not run.
- Web alphabet rail (`alphabet.css`, 768px and up): the rail is 24px wide, centred in the page's right gutter and `.alphabet-surface` no longer reserves 2rem, so Movies/list grids get the same width as History (6 columns at a 1500px window, 183px cards, where it had dropped to 5). Browser: measured at 1500px. iOS/Android: not applicable (web-only rail); not run.
- `ActionMenu` (`controls/Menu.jsx`, used only by `BulkActionBar`): on wide screens the Update Status, Add to List and More actions sheets now centre in the window; the `align` prop that pinned them to the left or right edge is removed. Phones still get the bottom sheet. Browser: checked More actions. iOS/Android: not run (Modal centring follows the same style).
- Native Library screen (`native-proof/app/screens/LibraryScreen.jsx`, `surfaces/LibraryBulkActions.jsx`): matches the web media list header. Title, count badge and a settings gear (`ActionMenu` with `actionIcons.settings`: Table/Grid View, Share View, Save View, Select Items/Cancel Select, saved views), then the three toolbar dropdowns (`FilterBar variant="toolbar"` with the new `showClear={false}`: web has no Clear button there, and the default media type filter made it always show; the Filters sheet keeps its own Clear). `ShellSlot` now rejects a navigation reply that is not a Floppy menu (Metro's HTML page on Expo Web) instead of crashing the Sidebar. The subtitle, the library search field, the always-visible Name this view / Save view row and the inline Select items / Share View buttons are gone; the name field appears only after Save View. Saved-view reorder/delete rows show with it. Consumers: native Library routes. Browser: not run (Expo Web local mode crashes in the sidebar before a library can open, unrelated). iOS/Android: iOS bundle compiles; not run on a device.
- Native Library settings (`surfaces/LibrarySettings.ios.jsx`, `LibrarySettings.jsx`, `LibrarySettingsGear.jsx`): on iOS with a side rail (hinge or vertical status bar) the settings gear is an `expo-router` `Stack.Toolbar placement="bottom"` menu (system Liquid Glass) at the bottom of the rail, with the same items; with no rail on iOS, and on Android and web, it stays as the `ActionMenu` gear in the header. Carve-out: Liquid Glass and the rail are iOS-only. Browser: gear unchanged. iOS: bundle compiles; not seen on a rail device. Android: unchanged, not run.
- Library settings menu icons and order: Grid/Table View (named for the current view, grid or table glyph), Share View (link / `square.and.arrow.up`), Save View (save / `square.and.arrow.down`), Select Items (check circle / `checkmark.circle`), then Saved views sorted by name. The view row sits alone at the top, a divider follows, and the rest are alphabetical (Save, Select, Share). The divider is a `{ separator: true }` row in `ActionMenu` and a separate inline menu in the iOS rail menu, which iOS separates with its own divider. `ActionMenu` (`controls/Menu.jsx`) rows now accept an optional `icon` spec, drawn before the label; rows without one are unchanged (BulkActionBar). The iOS rail menu uses each item's `symbol`. Browser/iOS/Android: not run; bundles compile.
- Settings gear menu (`frontend/ui/SettingsMenu.jsx`, web adapter `frontend/ui/mountSettingsMenu.jsx`, template `src/templates/app/components/media_settings_menu.html` now only the island host, props from `library_settings_menu_props`): the gear button and its rows on the app's standard `DropdownMenu` (the popover the Search media type and the sidebar options use), replacing the Alpine menu on web and the `ActionMenu` sheet in the native header. Same order, divider and icons everywhere: the view row names the current view (four-square or table) above a divider, then Save View, Select Items (check-circle; also on the list pages' `bulk_select_button.html`), Share View (`share.svg`) and Show matching entries separately. Web actions call the page's Alpine scope (`layoutHref`, `saveView`, `shareView`, `toggleSelectMode`) and post the entry-grouping form. Legacy: the Alpine menu is gone; `ActionMenu` still serves the bulk action bar. Browser: pending check. iOS rail uses the system bottom-toolbar menu instead (carve-out); Android/iOS without a rail use this component; not run.
- Dropdown rows (`frontend/ui/DropdownMenu.jsx` `DropdownItem`): one row component for the sidebar row options (`Sidebar.jsx` `MenuButton`), the Search media type menu (`GlobalSearch.jsx`) and the library settings menu (`SettingsMenu.jsx`), replacing three copies of the same row style. Size and spacing come from `dropdownMetrics`; each caller passes its palette's text and hover colours; hover, press and selected share one background. The Search menu keeps its own anchored container (it sits under the search field with no scrim); the sidebar and settings menus use `DropdownMenu`. Browser: settings and media type menus checked; sidebar row options not re-checked. iOS/Android: bundles compile; not run.
- Native Library filter dropdowns (`frontend/ui/FilterBar.jsx`, `variant="toolbar"`, consumers: native Library and List detail screens): the Filters, Status and Sort triggers open the standard anchored `DropdownMenu` with `DropdownItem` rows, `DropdownSeparator` and `DropdownHeading` (now shared exports of `DropdownMenu.jsx`, also used by `SettingsMenu`), instead of full sheets. Status and media types are checkable rows; Sort is radio rows plus A-Z / Z-A; Filters lists a Media type row (current summary and a chevron) that goes one level deeper in the same dropdown into the checkable multi-select, led by a back row, then section and range rows with their current value, then Clear all. The shared `DropdownItem` takes a `chevron` and `DropdownBackItem` leads the deeper level, so any menu can do the same. Sections (Genre, Year, Tags, with a search field over 8 options and the Tags any/all rows) and ranges (From/To, the relative "in the last" field and units, Apply, Clear) also go a level deeper inside the same dropdown with the shared `DropdownField`, so the toolbar variant no longer opens a sheet. The full variant (web island) keeps its sheets. Browser: not run (Expo Web cannot open a signed-in library). iOS/Android: bundles compile; not run on a device.
- Filters, Status and Sort dropdowns on web (`src/templates/app/components/filter_bar.html`, `frontend/ui/mountFilterBar.jsx`, `frontend/ui/FilterBar.jsx` `variant="toolbar"`): the shared toolbar now mounts on every page that wraps its toolbar in `filter_bar` (media list, list pages), on the same `DropdownMenu`/`DropdownItem` as Expo, with the Search media type's colours; the Alpine dropdowns stay only as the fallback until it mounts. Both platforms group the date options: the main list has one Date row, and the Date level holds Released, Release date (the From/To and relative range with the year list below it), Completed date and Date added, replacing Year, Released and three range rows on the main list. A range that shares its name with a section shows as "Rating range". Web actions write the page's Alpine filter state and call `applyFilterChange`. `DropdownMenu` now closes the way it opened: clearing the anchor in the same update as closing no longer switches to the dimmed fade, which flashed a dark overlay and left a click-blocking layer for about a second. Browser: opened the three dropdowns, the Date and Release date levels, applied a status; list detail not re-checked. iOS/Android: Date grouping shares this component; not run.
- Sort in the toolbar `FilterBar` (web and Expo): the trigger is two controls, the sort name (opens the dropdown) and its own arrow (up for ascending, down for descending) that flips the direction, so the dropdown has no direction rows. The date-based sorts (date added, release date, last watched, start date, episode air date; any sort whose value contains `date`) sit under one Date row, in the place of the first of them, with the current one shown on the row and a back row on the level. Browser: flipped the direction with the arrow and opened the Date level. iOS/Android: share this component; not run.
- Toolbar dropdown switching (`FilterBar.jsx` `closeMenu`): a press outside an open Filters, Status or Sort dropdown closes it, and if the press lands on another of the three triggers that trigger's dropdown opens in the same press (the press position is hit-tested against the triggers' window rectangles); pressing the open trigger again just closes it. Browser: Filters to Status to Sort in one click each. iOS/Android: uses the press's page position; not run. The settings gear and the Search media type menu are separate components and do not take part yet.
- Date level names (`FilterBar.jsx`, web and Expo): the Filters Date level lists Added date, Completed date, Release date (range with the year list) and Release status, and the Sort Date level uses the same names and order for the sorts (date added, end date as Completed date, release date, start date, episode air date as Air date), replacing server wording such as Date Added, Last Watched and Released. Names are labels (`addedDate`, `completedDate`, `releaseDate`, `releaseStatus`, `startDate`, `airDate`) the server also sends. Browser: both Date levels read in the new names. iOS/Android: shared component; not run.
- Device poses (`frontend/ui/devicePose.js` exports `resolvePose`, `poseValue` and `isPose`; `watchDevicePose` in the Expo hook `native-proof/app/data/useDevicePose.js`, the web adapter `frontend/settings/pose.web.js`, `PoseBadge`, Tailwind variants `pose-closed|open|vertical|horizontal`): the six poses (closed, open, partial by vertical, horizontal) as one vocabulary for Expo, the PWA and tests; a device with no hinge gets closed or open from its short side (under 600 is closed), so the iPhone follows the closed poses. No visual change yet: Media Details receives `pose` on its `heroViewport` and `data-pose` is set on `<html>`. See `docs/architecture/device-poses.md`. Browser: `data-pose` and the `?pose=debug` readout checked. iOS: hook and readout compile; not read on the Duo hardware. Android: not run.
- Shell on poses (`native-proof/app/surfaces/NativeShell.ios.jsx`, `menuGeometry.mjs`, `ShellSlot.jsx`, `components/Screen.ios.jsx`, `surfaces/LibrarySettings.ios.jsx`): the shell, sidebar geometry, rail-aware screens and the rail settings menu now read `useDevicePose()` instead of `expo-hinge` directly, so the sidebar and every other layout use one definition of closed, open and partial. `menuGeometry(width, pose, division)` takes the pose for the fold; the division still gives the split position. Behaviour is unchanged, including a phone in landscape keeping its side menu. Tests: `menuGeometry.test.mjs`, `devicePose.test.mjs`. iOS: bundle compiles; not run on the Duo.
- `DropdownMenu` placement (`dropdownMetrics.js` `dropdownPlacement`): the menu still right-aligns under its trigger, but when that would push it past the left screen edge (the toolbar's left-side filter triggers) it left-aligns to the trigger instead and is clamped inside the screen. Covered by `dropdownMenu.test.mjs`. Browser: gear menu still right-aligned. iOS/Android: not run.
- `DropdownMenu` `align` (`dropdownMetrics.js` `dropdownPlacement`): `end` (default; the gear, row dots) keeps right-aligning under the trigger; `start` (the toolbar's Filters, Status and Sort, on web and Expo) lines the menu's left edge up with the trigger and only slides it left when it would run past the right edge. Covered by `dropdownMenu.test.mjs`. Browser: Filters and Sort menus open exactly at their trigger's left edge. iOS/Android: not run.
- `DropdownMenu` safe area (`DropdownInsetsContext` in `frontend/ui/keyboardOverlapContext.js`, supplied by native `ThemeRoot` from `useSafeAreaInsets`; web has none): placement and height use the screen less the safe area, so a menu opened near the iOS side rail slides left to stay beside it instead of under it, and the bottom inset limits its height and flip. Covered by `dropdownMenu.test.mjs`. iOS: bundle compiles; not run on the Duo yet.
- `DropdownMenu` keyboard awareness: the menu reads how far the keyboard covers the window (the same adapters the Search suggestions use: `native-proof/app/data/useKeyboardOverlap.js` on native, `frontend/ui/keyboardOverlap.web.js` from the visual viewport on web, supplied through `KeyboardOverlapContext` by `ThemeRoot` and the web `mountRoot`) and shortens itself to what the keyboard leaves visible. Placement ignores the keyboard, so opening it never moves the menu: the top stays under its trigger and only the bottom comes up, the list scrolling. On iOS the native hook listens to the `Will` keyboard events and runs the resize on the keyboard's own duration and curve (`LayoutAnimation`), so the menu and the Search suggestions move in step with it; Android reports the keyboard only once it has settled, and web follows the visual viewport, so neither animates in flight. Browser: not run with a keyboard. iOS/Android: bundles compile; not run with a keyboard.
- Native `Screen` (`native-proof/app/components/Screen.ios.jsx`, shared `Screen.jsx` takes a new `scrollStyle`): with a side rail the page's `ScrollView` reaches under the rail (negative horizontal margin equal to the safe-area insets) and its content padding gives the rail's width back, so a drag that starts on the rail scrolls the page as in other iPhone Duo apps and the layout is unchanged. Only screens built on `Screen` (19 of them) get this; the Collection screen, Detail features, playback and the pickers keep their own scroll views and are not changed. iOS only (Android/web have no rail). Browser: n/a. iOS: bundle compiles; not run on the Duo.

### CONTROL-KIT — Shared control kit

- Shared Tabs explicitly exposes aria-selected while retaining its selected accessibility state. Native Activity wraps the selected MAL panel in a named tabpanel and preserves the level-2 panel headings. All four empty tabs were exercised against the browser page with matching copy; the semantics adjustment awaits recheck. Existing web/native consumers and retirement conditions are unchanged; current iOS/Android verification remains open.
- Status: `Partial / coexisting`
- Native readiness: `Primitives` for the shared controls; browser adapters stay per-platform.
- Purpose/usage: Shared control primitives for forms, dialogs, menus and catalog surfaces.
- DateTimePicker: the open and clear controls are drawn from shared views, not the letters `v` and `x`. Browser verified in the Track dialog; iOS and Android not verified.
- TrackForm / TrackTabs / TrackDialog: restored the v26.10.29 modal layout (title bar, icon sidebar with the General tab, two-column General grid, dropdown selects, markdown notes, Delete / Rewatch + Since / Update footer). Tab icons come from the server's `file_icon` specs. Browser verified; iOS and Android not verified. Still different from v26.10.29: the Score spinner buttons and the Just Finished chip inside the date field. The Track dialog (`mountTrackForm.jsx`) also follows the card's Alpine open flag, so it closes after a save swaps its popup out of the page; browser tests pick Status through the dropdown. Browser verified; iOS and Android not verified.
- Track modal tabs (Tags plain list, Collection copy fields, Status history, Discover visibility) and the shared SelectField chevron now follow the v26.10.29 layout. Browser verified against the old build; iOS and Android not verified.

- Collection detail Summary, CollectionEntryGroup, CollectionEpisodeList, CollectionEpisodeToggle, CollectionShowMore and CollectionSectionHeading: shared props-only `CollectionContextCard` in `CollectionCopyDialog`, used by the Expo detail sheet and the web Collection dialog through a browser adapter. Status: partial/coexisting; web retains its server-owned editing controls inside the shared group; the native Collection screen and detail sheet use the same group for copies; detail shows season audit rows and read-only episode disclosures including missing locally known episodes; web and Expo initially show five collection rows with the shared show-more control; the web footer compensates for its server-rendered final row’s different margin and keeps the collapsed and expanded spacing consistent, with a consistent divider position and season edits and removal through the collection API. Resolution breakdown, completion and the Missing row use episode coverage; the latest copy determines each episode’s resolution, and specials are excluded from show totals. A secondary disclosure groups copies by season and episode with titles and comma-separated resolutions, initially limiting the list to five rows when an item has multiple copies. PWA: earlier Summary inspected on a physical Duo; grouped entry card and edit interactions not runtime verified. Desktop browser: not verified. iOS: grouped entries, expanded episodes including a Missing row, and 68-of-69 summary inspected on a physical Duo; save and remove not runtime verified. Android: not verified.

- `frontend/ui/sectionSpacing.js`: `sectionSpacing` shares Home shelf and Collection section gaps across viewport sizes. Web, iOS and Android: pure shared layout rule; runtime verification follows its consumers.

- `frontend/ui/MarkdownPreview.jsx` and `frontend/ui/MusicParts.jsx`: registered in the architecture registry and source map (they were committed without entries). `MarkdownPreview.jsx` is the shared React Native preview; `.native.jsx` now wraps it like Reveal and `.web.jsx` stays the web adapter. `detail_seasons_row.html` is mapped as a server fallback. Web, iOS and Android: structural only; no new rendering evidence.

DropdownMenu remains shared and partial/coexisting across its existing consumers. Its keyboard-driven sizing runs inside the native modal host, including the Duo rail, with an explicit iOS height animation; Android applies the settled keyboard size; the user accepted the quartic animation on a physical iOS Duo; browser and Android animation remain unverified. Existing fallback retirement conditions are unchanged.
