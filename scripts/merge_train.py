"""Keep pull requests up to date with latest, one at a time, so auto-merge can land them.

latest requires a pull request to be up to date before it merges, and GitHub's
merge queue is not available on a personal repository. Auto-merge alone then stalls:
after any merge every other waiting PR is behind and nothing updates it. This script
is the queue. Among open PRs that have auto-merge switched on (the owner's approval),
it walks them in the order auto-merge was enabled and acts on the first one that can
still merge:

- behind latest: merge latest into it (this restarts CI, and auto-merge lands it),
- up to date and its checks are running or about to merge: it is the one in flight
  and the others wait their turn.

"Behind" is decided by comparing the PR head with the current latest commit, not by
GitHub's mergeStateStatus, which reads UNKNOWN while it recalculates and BLOCKED
while checks run. A PR that cannot merge as it is (conflict, failed or hung required
check, checks that never started, a fork branch the token may not update) is skipped
with the reason, so it cannot hold the queue; its author has to act.

The run exits 0 when a PR was updated, one is in flight, or the queue is empty. It
exits 1 when the queue has PRs but none could advance because of a problem, so a
stuck train shows up as a red run instead of a green one.

Usage: merge_train.py [--dry-run]    (needs GH_TOKEN and GH_REPO)
