"""Decide whether a push to latest may reuse its pull request's green test run.

The Docker publish gate re-runs the three test shards on every push to latest.
When the push is a pull request merge and the pull request's own App Tests run
already executed on a commit with *exactly the same tree*, that second run adds
nothing. This script decides, from Git and the GitHub API only, whether that is
the case. It prints "reuse" only when every condition below holds, and "run" for
everything else, including any error. It never fails the job: a crash here must
not be able to skip tests, so the workflow treats anything but a clean "reuse"
as "run the full gate".

Identity is the Git tree, not the commit. A merge commit never equals the pull
request head, but a tree hash names the complete content of the checkout:
sources, tests, lockfile, workflows and tooling. Two commits with the same tree
give a test run byte-identical input files.

The tested tree is read from GitHub's own record of the run, not inferred from
the pull request head. A pull_request run executes on GitHub's test merge commit
(refs/pull/N/merge). The run's ``head_sha`` is the pull request head, which has
a different tree whenever the branch was behind its base. The test merge commit
is reported in ``referenced_workflows`` (present because App Tests references
the local lint workflow), as ``sha`` with ``ref: refs/pull/N/merge``. That also
ties the run to one pull request, which ``head_sha`` cannot: two pull requests
can share a head commit and target different bases.

Conditions for "reuse" (all of them):

 1. The event is a push to refs/heads/latest.
 2. The pushed commit is associated with exactly one pull request, which is
    merged into latest in this repository with this commit as its merge commit.
 3. The newest App Tests pull_request run for that pull request's head is
    completed and successful, is this repository's .github/workflows/app-tests.yml,
    and ran on refs/pull/N/merge for that same pull request.
 4. The commit that run executed is a merge whose second parent is the pull
    request head, and its tree equals the pushed commit's tree.
 5. The run's "test (3.12)" job succeeded on the latest attempt, and the run did
    not change while it was being inspected.
 6. The run started no more than MAX_AGE ago.

With REUSE_PR_TEST_RESULTS unset the script still evaluates and reports what it
would have decided, but always outputs "run" (shadow mode).

Usage: reuse_pr_tests.py    (reads GITHUB_* and GH_TOKEN from the environment)
