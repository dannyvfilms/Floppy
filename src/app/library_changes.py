"""Keep ``updated_at`` honest for changes that are not edits of the row itself.

A tracking row's own writes stamp ``updated_at`` (see ``Media.save`` and
``ImportScopedQuerySet``). List and tag membership live in other tables yet show
up on the media list (``lists``, ``tags``), so an incremental client would miss
them. These signals stamp the affected user's tracking rows for that item.
