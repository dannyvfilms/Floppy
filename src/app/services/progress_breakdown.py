"""Per-season, per-episode breakdown of how much of a show the user has watched.

The result is plain data so the same component can render one show in a modal
today and a row per show on a library progress page later.

Watched means finished at least once, in any pass. While a rewatch is open the
breakdown also reports how much of the current pass is done, using the same
pass-aware numbers as the progress card. The episode list comes from the
provider catalogue. An episode only counts toward a total once it has aired,
and specials and dropped seasons stay out of the overall figures, matching the
card's percentage.
