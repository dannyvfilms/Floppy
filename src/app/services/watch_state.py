"""Write-through projection and reader for canonical watched state.

The projection is a *recompute*, not a delta: given a (user, item) it reads the
legacy stores and upserts one ``WatchState`` row. That makes it idempotent, so a
double invocation is harmless and a path this module does not yet hook can be
reconciled later by calling the same function. Incremental deltas would have to
be correct at every one of the dozens of call sites that mutate tracking rows.

Projection is also how *local* decisions reach the change log. Once a user has
an active synchronizing connection, a recompute that finds the stores have moved
records that movement as a change, so every existing write path — the UI, the
API, the webhooks, the importers — emits an ordered change without any of them
being edited. Until then it writes state silently, which is what keeps an
upgrade's backfill from pushing a whole library outward.
